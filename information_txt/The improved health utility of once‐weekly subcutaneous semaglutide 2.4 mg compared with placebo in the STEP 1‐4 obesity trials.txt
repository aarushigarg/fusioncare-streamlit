Aim: To assess health utility values in the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People
with obesity (STEP) 1-4 trials.Materials and Methods: The STEP 1-4 phase 3a, 68-week, double-blind randomized
controlled trials assessed the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus pla-
cebo in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m
2or higher or a BMI of
27 kg/m2or higher and at least one comorbidity (STEP 1, 3 and 4), or a BMI of
27 kg/m2or higher and type 2 diabetes (STEP 2). Patients received lifestyle interven-
tion plus intensive behavioural therapy in STEP 3. Health-related quality of life was
assessed using the Short Form 36-item Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) at baselineand week 68. Scores were converted into Short Form Six-Dimension version 2
(SF-6Dv2) utility scores or mapped onto the European Quality of Life Five-Dimension
Three-Level (EQ-5D-3L) utility index using UK health utility weights.
Results: At week 68, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with minor health utility
score improvements from baseline (all trials), while scores for placebo typicallydecreased. SF-6Dv2 treatment differences by week 68 for semaglutide 2.4
mg versus placebo were significant in STEP 1 and 4 ( P≤.001), but not STEP 2 or
3. EQ-5D-3L treatment differences by week 68 for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus pla-
cebo were significant in STEP 1, 2 and 4 ( P< .001 for all), but not STEP 3.
Conclusions: Semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with improvement in health utility
scores compared with placebo, reaching statistical significance in STEP 1, 2 and 4.

1|INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a complex chronic disease with interacting genetic, environ-
mental and behavioural factors.1People living with obesity have anincreased risk of complications, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardio-
vascular disease, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis,depression and impaired quality of life (QoL), among others.

complications, improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduce
health care utilization and costs.3-5Once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.)
semaglutide 2.4 mg is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue approved for
use in major geographies including the United States, the UK, the
European Union and Canada. Semaglutide 2.4 mg is used as an adjunctto a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic
weight management in people with obesity (body mass index [BMI]
≥30 kg/m
2), or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) with weight-related
comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, T2D or dyslipidaemia).6-10The safety
and efficacy of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg was shown in the
global phase 3a Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity(STEP) programme. In the STEP trials, people with obesity treated withsemaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a weight loss of 15% to 17% sustained
over 68 weeks in people with overweight and obesity without
T2D.
11-13
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed throughout the
trials using the Short Form 36-item Health Survey version 2 (SF-
36v2). In health economic assessments, HRQoL is often summarizedusing a single ‘health utility ’value with scores anchored at 0 (equiva-
lent to death) and 1 (perfect health).
14The cost –benefit of treatment
can be calculated by combining health utility values with a time hori-zon to form quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates.
14These ana-
lyses can be used to inform policy based on cost-effectiveness by
comparing the incremental costs of an intervention with the incre-mental gain in QALYs.
There are many generic instruments for estimating health utilities;
among the most frequently used are the European Quality of Life
Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) and the Short Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D) utility
indices.
15,16Here, we report the effect of treatment with once-weekly
s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo on the SF-6D version 2 (SF-6Dv2)
and EQ-5D-Three-Level (EQ-5D-3L) utility scores across the STEP 1-4trials.
11-13,17
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Trial designs and populations (STEP 1-4)
STEP 1-4 were 68-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trials
assessing the efficacy and safety of semaglutide (2.4 mg s.c. once
weekly) versus placebo for weight management in adults with obesityor overweight.
11-13,17Key enrolment criteria, study objectives and
endpoints are summarized in the subsequent paragraph and shown in
Table S1. All trials complied with the International Conference onHarmonization Good Clinical Practice Guideline and the Declaration
of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent.
Briefly, STEP 1, 3 and 4 enrolled adults (age ≥18 years) with obe-
sity (BMI ≥30 kg/m
2) or with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and at least
one weight-related co-morbidity.11,13,17STEP 2 enrolled adults with a
BMI of 27 kg/m2or higher and T2D who had been treated with either
diet and exercise alone or with a stable dose of up to three glucose-lowering agents within 90 days before screening.
12Key exclusion cri-
teria were self-reported weight change of 5 kg or more within 90 days
before screening, or obesity treatment with surgery or a weight-lossdevice.11-13,17Comorbidities evaluated at the time of screening were
dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovasculardisease, obstructive sleep apnoea, impaired glucose metabolism, repro-
ductive system disorders, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoarthritis,
gout, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2.1.1 | Treatment
In STEP 1, 1961 participants were randomized 2:1 to s.c. semaglutide2.4 mg or placebo, in combination with lifestyle intervention.
11In
STEP 2, 1210 participants were randomized 1:1:1 to s.c. semaglutide2.4 mg, s.c. semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo, in combination with life-
style intervention.
12In STEP 3, 611 participants were randomized 2:1
to s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, as an adjunct to intensive beha-vioural therapy and initial low-calorie diet.
13In STEP 4, 902 partici-
pants received open-label, once-weekly s.c. semaglutide during a
20-week run-in period that included a 16-week dose escalation periodand 4 weeks on the target semaglutide dose of 2.4 mg. After the run-
in period, 803 participants were randomized (2:1) to either continued
semaglutide 2.4 mg or switched to placebo, for a further 48 weeks.Participants received semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo in combination
with lifestyle intervention for the trial duration (68 weeks).
17
2.1.2 | Trial endpoints
STEP 1, 2 and 3 included the co-primary endpoints percentage change
in body weight from baseline to week 68 and the achievement of a
reduction in body weight of 5% or more at week 68. These endpoints
were evaluated separately; however, superiority had to be shown forboth to achieve the primary objective.
11-13In STEP 4, the primary
endpoint was the percentage change in body weight from week 20 to
week 68.17‘Baseline ’corresponded to week 0 in all trials, except
STEP 4, in which randomization (baseline) followed a 20-week run-inperiod, during which all participants received semaglutide. The analy-
sis of health utility scores was based on the trial product estimand,
which modelled the average effect in all randomly assigned patients,assuming that patients had remained on treatment for the duration of
the trials, and without initiation of obesity rescue medication.
Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints included the proportion
of participants achieving a reduction in body weight of 10% or more,
or 15% or more at week 68 (with the exception of STEP 4); and
change from baseline to week 68 in waist circumference, systolicblood pressure and PRO assessments, including the SF-36v2 physical
functioning score.
2.1.3 | Change in body weight at week 68
In the STEP 1-4 trials, estimated mean weight changes from randomi-
zation to week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. placebo) for the trial
product estimand were /C016.9% ( /C02.4%), /C010.6% ( /C03.1%), /C017.6%
(/C05.0%) and /C08.8% (6.5%), respectively.11-13,17BJORNER ET AL. 2143

2.2 |HRQoL assessments in STEP 1-4
HRQoL was assessed in the STEP 1-4 trials using the SF-36v2 com-
prising 36 questions (items) across eight domains (physical function-
ing, role limitations because of physical health problems, bodily pain,general health perception, vitality, social functioning, role limitations
because of emotional problems, and mental health).
14,18Changes from
baseline to week 68 in the individual domains were analysed as pre-specified secondary endpoints in the STEP 1-4 trials.
11-13,17
Across the STEP 1-4 trials, there were greater improvements in
SF-36v2 physical functioning scores with semaglutide 2.4 mg thanwith placebo at week 68: STEP 1: 2.6 versus 0.5 points, STEP 2: 2.7
versus 0.7 points, STEP 3: 2.4 versus 1.5 points and STEP 4: 1.0 ver-
sus/C01.0 points.
11-13,17
2.3 |Scoring of the SF-6Dv2 and EQ-5D-3L utility
scores
In the current analysis, SF-36v2 scores were analysed post hoc and
used to derive the SF-6Dv2 and EQ-5D-3L health utility scores usingpreviously validated methods.19,20The item responses from STEP 1-4
were directly used to assign the SF-6Dv2 utility scores16,19and
SF-36v2 scale scores were mapped onto the EQ-5D-3L utility index
using an established mapping algorithm (Figure 1).20For national
decision-making, it is recommended to use country-specific utilityweights (value sets) that reflect the health preferences of individual
countries.
21This analysis used utility weights for the UK.
2.3.1 | SF-6Dv2 utility scores
The SF-6D classification system is one of the generic measures ofhealth most widely used to calculate QALYs.
16It uses responses from
11 SF-36 items to define health on six dimensions (physical function-ing, role limitations, pain, vitality, social functioning and mentalhealth). Each dimension is assessed using four to six severity levels
that are combined to produce an overall health utility score.
16
The SF-6Dv2 tool, a revised version of the SF-6D, was devel-
oped to increase the score range, and to adjust and clarify the
assessment of some dimensions of HRQoL.16The SF-6Dv2 includes
six dimensions (physical functioning, role participation, social

functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality), and is scored
from 10 items in the SF-36v2 with fiv e or six severity levels for each
dimension.16
Using UK utility weights, the SF-6Dv2 has a range from /C00.574 to
1, anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. Of the 18 750 pos-
sible health states defined by the SF-6Dv2, 15.0% are below 0, indicat-ing that they are valued as worse than death (e.g. a state of being in
very severe pain and having depression/anxiety all the time).
19
2.3.2 | EQ-5D utility scores
The EQ-5D assesses HRQoL in five dimensions (mobility, self-care,
usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Eachdimension is assessed using either three response levels (EQ-5D-3L)
or five response levels (EQ-5D-5L) relating to perceived problems
(none, some, moderate, severe and extreme).14Mapping algorithms
have also been established that d erive EQ-5D-3L health utility
scores from responses to other he alth surveys, including the SF-36
survey.20Rowen et al. used a random effects generalized least
squares model, including SF-36 dimensions, squared terms and
dimension interactions applied to inpatient data from the prospec-
tive ‘Health Outcomes Data Repository ’, which includes responses
from more than 23 000 inpatients to SF-36 and EQ-5D questions.20
This model was used to derive the EQ-5D-3L utility scores from the
SF-36v2 scores in the STEP trial s. The EQ-5D-3L tool produces
health utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfecthealth.TABLE 1 Frequency of comorbiditiesaat baseline in the STEP 1-4 trials11-13,17

2.4 |Statistical analysis
Health utility values were analysed for each trial using a mixed model
for repeated measurements. This model handles missing data implic-
itly under the missing at random assumption. All responses before first
discontinuation of treatment or initiation of other weight manage-ment drugs or bariatric surgery were included according to the trial
product estimand.
11-13,17
The mixed model included randomized treatment as a
factor and baseline health utili ty score as covariate, all nested
within visit. For STEP 2, the stratification groups (oral anti-
diabetic treatment status and HbA1c category at screening)and the interaction between stratification groups were included inthe statistical model as additional factors. Results from statistical
analysis were accompanied by two-sided 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) and corresponding Pvalues (significance defined as
P≤.05 in this analysis). The presented analysis was not adjusted for
multiplicity. The method for analysing health utility scores is identicalto the prespecified analysis for the individual SF-36 domain scores
according to the trial product estimand.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Overview of STEP 1-4 baseline
characteristics
The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of enrolled
patients were generally comparable across treatment groups in the
STEP 1-4 trials, as shown in Table S2. The majority of patients werefemale (47.1%-88.2%), white (58.7%-84.3%) and their mean age ran-ged from 46 to 55 years. Across the individual trials at baseline (week
0), body weight ranged from 99.9 to 107.2 kg, and BMI and waist cir-
cumference ranged from 34.1-35.3 to 38.4 kg/m
2and from
104.7-111.8 to 115.5 cm, respectively. The trials included participants
with T2D (100% of the STEP 2 population) and without T2D, withTABLE 2 Indexation of estimated mean health utility scores in the STEP 1-4atrials

either normoglycaemia or prediabetes at baseline (ranging from 47.1%
to 85.0% and from 15% to 52.9%, respectively, in STEP 1, 3 and4).
11-13,17In addition, participants in STEP 2 also received additional
antidiabetic medication (up to three oral antidiabetic drugs) compared
with the other trials.
3.2 |Frequency of comorbidities in STEP 1-4
There were differences in the overall number and type of comorbid-
ities identified across the trials. In STEP 1, 3 and 4, approximately
75% of participants enrolled had at least one co-morbidity at baseline,as shown in Table
1. In STEP 2, where T2D was an inclusion criterion,
the majority of participants had two or more additional comorbidities
at baseline (Table 1). In this trial, greater proportions of patients had
concomitant dyslipidaemia, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver dis-ease or coronary artery disease, approximately 2-fold higher or more,
than those in STEP 1, 3 and 4. The proportions of patients with other
comorbidities were similar across the trials, although slightly smallerproportions in STEP 2 had asthma or COPD than in STEP 1, 3 and 4.
3.3 |SF-6Dv2 and EQ-5D-3L utility scores in
STEP 1-4
3.3.1 | Baseline utility scores
At baseline, in the STEP 1-3 tri als, mean overall SF-6Dv2 and
EQ-5D-3L utility scores ranged from 0.835 to 0.851 and from0.881 to 0.905, respectively. T he correspondi ng values for
STEP 4 at week 0 before the run-in period were 0.860 and 0.911,
respectively. After the 20-week run-in of semaglutide treatment
for all participants, the mean baseline overall SF-6Dv2 and EQ-5D-
3L utility scores were 0.869 and 0.926 (Table
2). Baseline healthstatus was perceived as being good across STEP 1-4 despite the
presence of co-morbidities based on the comparison of mean SF-6Dv2 and EQ-5D scores to published norms.
20,22
3.3.2 | Change in utility scores at 68 weeks
At week 68, improvements in SF-6Dv2 and EQ-5D-3L were observedwith semaglutide 2.4 mg across all trials, whereas scores typicallydecreased with placebo (Table

4|DISCUSSION
Clinical studies have shown the weight-loss benefits of treatment
with once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with overweight
or obesity, both with and without T2D.11-13,17,23-25
The current analysis showed that treatment with semaglutide
2.4 mg is also associated with improvements in HRQoL. Significant
improvements with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo were observed

in STEP 1 and 4 for SF-6Dv2, and in STEP 1, 2 and 4 for EQ-5D-3L
health utility scores. Furthermore, SF-6Dv2 and EQ-5D results wereconsistent across the trials, although the variance was greater in SF-
6Dv2 than in EQ-5D.
The lack of statistical significance for the effect of semaglutide
versus placebo on SF-6Dv2 in STEP 2 may be explained by the trial
population, which only included patients with diagnosed T2D (average
disease duration of 8.2 years and patients using up to three antidia-betic medications).
12By contrast, patients in the other STEP trials
were either normoglycaemic or were in the early stages of diabetes
(prediabetes).11-13,17This may have an important role in different
results observed between the trials. Across STEP 1-4, participants inSTEP 2 treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg had the lowest relative body
weight change from week 0 to week 68.
11-13,17Differences between
trials in populations and background therapies may have influencedthe weight losses observed in each trial. Patients in STEP 1, 3 and 4
had a lower comorbidity burden (the majority had one or more), com-
pared with those in STEP 2 with a higher burden (the majority hadthree or more including T2D). Additionally, the type of comorbid ill-
ness differed between the trials. Greater proportions of patients in
STEP 2 had dyslipidaemia, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver dis-ease or coronary artery disease, compared with those in the other tri-
als. The highest presence of co-morbidities at baseline in STEP 2 was
also consistent with the lowest mean health utility score (0.835 and0.881 for SF6Dv2 and EQ-5D-3L, respectively) observed across STEP1-4. Nevertheless, improvements in HRQoL have previously been
observed with once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg versus
placebo in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk, with effectsmediated partly by changes in HbA1c and body weight,
26as well as
with once-daily oral semaglutide versus dulaglutide in patients with
T2D in Japan.27
Difference in additional therapy may also contribute to the
changes in SF-36v2 and EQ-5D-3L scores observed across the trials.
The lack of statistical significance in STEP 3 for treatment differenceswith respect to either health utility score may reflect the intensivebehavioural therapy, which also included an initial low-calorie diet,
offered to both the placebo and semaglutide groups in this trial.
13The
behavioural therapy contributed to greater weight loss in the placebogroup in STEP 3 compared with the other trials, such that no
(or negligible) decline occurred in HRQoL in the placebo group.
By contrast, the larger treatment differences in mean health util-
ity score observed in STEP 4 may reflect the two-stage design of this
trial, in which one-third of participants who reached the semaglutide
maintenance dose of 2.4 mg at week 20 were randomized to placebofor the remainder of the trial. By week 68, the placebo group had
gained weight relative to week 20, which may explain the compara-
tively large difference between semaglutide and placebo groups withrespect to change in HRQoL.
17
It is important to note that across the studies, baseline health util-
ity scores were generally high, with limited room for improvement.
Treatment differences were typically driven by an increase in meanhealth utility score in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and a decrease in
mean health utility score in the placebo group.A limitation of the current study is that the EQ-5D scores were
derived by a mapping from the SF-36v2, and not from the originalEQ-5D survey. The mapping algorithm may overpredict the utility
score for people in more severe health states, which can also limit the
room for improvement.
20In addition, HRQoL was not collected or
reported after the randomized treatment phase was complete in the
STEP 1-4 trials. Differences in health status may be evident following
trial end given that weight regain can occur after pharmacologicaltreatment is stopped. In the STEP 1 extension study, participants
regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss with semaglutide in the
first year,
28while substantial weight regain was reported in other
studies with orlistat and loracserin.29,30This effect was partially
explored with the STEP 4 randomized withdrawal trial design, where a
larger decrease in utility score was evident in the placebo group after
randomization compared with the other STEP trials.
While some of the greatest increases in health utility in the sema-
glutide arm were observed in STEP 3, the difference between sema-
glutide and placebo effects on health utility was non-significant in thistrial, because of the lack of deterioration in the control group, perhaps
caused by the intensive behavioural intervention. Self-perceived
improvements may become more evident as physical capabilitiesimprove; when physical exercise is an integrated part of treatment, as
with intensive behavioural therapy, this effect may be further
enhanced.
31This interplay between medical and behavioural treat-
ment warrants further research.
Caution should always be used when comparing clinical pro-
grammes of different therapeutic interventions, even in patient
populations with similar demographics, disease status and co-mor-bidities. However, health utility analysis may enable HRQoL
improvements with a given treatment to be translated into a health
utility score, which may indicate or confirm clinical improvements.In a pooled meta-analysis of six randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to
evaluate health utility using SF-36 and mapped EQ-5D scores, insu-
lin degludec was associated with a modest but significant improve-ment in health utility compared with insulin glargine in 4001patients with diabetes.
32Further health utility analyses are war-
ranted in patients with overweight or obesity.
The current analysis used prespecified HRQoL outcome data
from the phase 3 STEP 1-4 RCTs, in selected patient populations
within a controlled trial setting. It is, therefore, probable that these
health utility scores would differ from those based on data collected
prospectively from real-world clinical practice. While RCTs remain
the gold standard for determining cl inical efficacy, real-world evi-
dence (RWE) enables assessment within a wider context, focusingon effectiveness and treatment-re lated costs of lifestyle modifica-
tion and pharmacotherapy in broader patient populations with vary-
ing baseline characteristics.
33,34A previous RWE study of electronic
health records from patients with T2D undergoing bariatric surgeryreported similar postsurgical reductions in HbA1c and BMI to clini-
cal trials.
35As such, RWE-confirmed health utility scores would
probably complement and lend further weight to findings obtainedwithin the clinical trial environment, and this research may generate
interesting findings.2148 BJORNER ET AL.

In conclusion, once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg was
associated with improvement in health utility scores comparedwith placebo, reaching statistical significance for STEP 1 and 4 with
SF-6Dv2, and for STEP 1, 2 and 4 with EQ-5D scores. Baseline utility
scores were generally high, and treatment differences were typicallydriven by an increase in mean utility score in the semaglutide 2.4 mg
group and a decrease in mean utility score in the placebo group.
These observations, in addition to the weight loss benefits reportedin the primary analyses for the individual STEP 1-4 trials, show how
health-related utility scores may indicate improvements in patients
with overweight or obesity in an RCT setting.
