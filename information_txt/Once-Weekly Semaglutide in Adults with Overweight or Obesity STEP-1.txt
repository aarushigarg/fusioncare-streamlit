Obesity is a global health challenge with few pharmacologic options. Whether 
adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose 
of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.
METHODS
In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater 
(≥27 in persons with ≥1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have 
diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment 
with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus 
lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body 
weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise descrip -
tion of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed 
effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.
RESULTS
The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was −14.9% in the 
semaglutide group as compared with −2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment 
difference of −12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], −13.4 to −11.5; 
P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group 
achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 
10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 
[4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body 
weight from baseline to week 68 was −15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as com -
pared with −2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, −12.7 kg; 
95% CI, −13.7 to −11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater im -
provement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in 
participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received 
placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with sema -
glutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided 
with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group 
discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).
CONCLUSIONS
In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly 
plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduc -
tion in body weight. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; STEP 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number,

Obesity is a chronic disease and 
global public health challenge.1-3 Obesity 
can lead to insulin resistance, hyperten -
sion, and dyslipidemia,4 is associated with com -
plications such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,2,5 
and reduces life expectancy.6 More recently, obe -
sity has been linked to increased numbers of hos -
pitalizations, the need for mechanical ventilation, 
and death in persons with coronavirus disease 
2019 (Covid-19).7,8
Although lifestyle intervention (diet and exer -
cise) represents the cornerstone of weight man -
agement,1,2 sustaining weight loss over the long 
term is challenging.9 Clinical guidelines suggest 
adjunctive pharmacotherapy, particularly for adults 
with a body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilo -
grams divided by the square of the height in 
meters) of 30 or greater, or 27 or greater in 
persons with coexisting conditions.1,2,10 However, 
the use of available medications remains limited 
by modest efficacy, safety concerns, and cost.3
Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
analogue that is approved, at doses up to 1 mg 
administered subcutaneously once weekly, for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults and for re -
ducing the risk of cardiovascular events in per -
sons with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dis -
ease.11 Semaglutide induced weight loss in persons 
with type 2 diabetes and in adults with obesity 
who were participants in a phase 2 trial,12-14 
findings that supported further investigation. 
The global phase 3 Semaglutide Treatment Ef -
fect in People with Obesity (STEP) program aims 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of semaglu -
tide administered subcutaneously at a dose of 
2.4 mg once weekly in persons with overweight 
or obesity, with or without weight-related com -
plications.15
This 68-week trial evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of semaglutide as compared with placebo 
as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention for reducing 
body weight and meeting other related end points 
in adults with overweight or obesity and without 
diabetes.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, pla -
cebo-controlled trial at 129 sites in 16 countries 
in Asia, Europe, North America, and South Amer -ica. The sponsor (Novo Nordisk) designed the trial 
and oversaw its conduct. The design has been 
published previously.15 The trial was conducted 
in accordance with the principles of the Declara -
tion of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines. The protocol (available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org) was approved by 
an independent ethics committee or institutional 
review board at each study site. Investigators were 
responsible for data collection, and the sponsor 
undertook site monitoring, data collation, and 
analysis. All authors had full access to study data, 
participated in drafting the manuscript (assisted 
by a sponsor-funded medical writer), approved its 
submission for publication, and vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Participants
We enrolled adults (18 years of age or older) with 
one or more self-reported unsuccessful dietary 
efforts to lose weight and either a BMI of 30 or 
greater or a BMI of 27 or greater with one or 
more treated or untreated weight-related coexist -
ing conditions (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease). 
A subgroup of participants with a BMI of 40 or 
less underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) to assess body composition. All participants 
provided written informed consent. Key exclu -
sion criteria were diabetes, a glycated hemoglobin 
level of 48 mmol per mole (6.5%) or greater, a 
history of chronic pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis 
within 180 days before enrollment, previous sur -
gical obesity treatment, and use of antiobesity 
medication within 90 days before enrollment. A 
full list of the eligibility criteria is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Procedures
Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ra -
tio, through the use of an interactive Web-based 
response system, to receive semaglutide at a 
dose of 2.4 mg administered subcutaneously 
once a week for 68 weeks or matching placebo, 
in addition to lifestyle intervention; this 68-week 
period was followed by a 7-week period without 
receipt of semaglutide or placebo or lifestyle 
intervention. Semaglutide, administered with a 
prefilled pen injector, was initiated at a dose of 
0.25 mg once weekly for the first 4 weeks, with 
the dose increased every 4 weeks to reach the A Quick Take

maintenance dose of 2.4 mg weekly by week 16 
(lower maintenance doses were permitted if 
participants had unacceptable side effects with 
the 2.4-mg dose) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Participants received individual coun -
seling sessions every 4 weeks to help them 
adhere to a reduced-calorie diet (500-kcal defi -
cit per day relative to the energy expenditure 
estimated at the time they underwent random -
ization) and increased physical activity (with 
150 minutes per week of physical activity, such 
as walking, encouraged). Both diet and activity 
were recorded daily in a diary or by use of a 
smartphone application or other tools and were 
reviewed during counseling sessions. Participants 
discontinuing treatment prematurely remained 
in the trial.
End Points and Assessments
The coprimary end points were the percentage 
change in body weight from baseline to week 68 
and achievement of a reduction in body weight 
of 5% or more from baseline to week 68. Con -
firmatory secondary end points (in hierarchical 
testing order) were achievement of a reduction in 
body weight of 10% or more and 15% or more 
by week 68 and the change from baseline to 
week 68 in waist circumference, systolic blood 
pressure, physical functioning score on the 36-item 
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), version 2, and 
physical function score on the Impact of Weight 
on Quality of Life–Lite Clinical Trials Version 
(IWQOL-Lite-CT) questionnaire. (Assessments re -
lated to end points, along with supportive sec -
ondary and exploratory end points and safety 
assessments, are described in the Supplementary 
Appendix.) Body composition (total fat, total lean 
body mass, and regional [abdominal] visceral fat 
mass) was measured in the DXA subpopulation 
as a supportive secondary end point. Safety as -
sessments included the number of adverse events 
occurring during the on-treatment period (the 
time during which participants received any dose 
of semaglutide or placebo within the previous 
49 days, with any period of temporary interrup -
tion of the regimen excluded) and serious adverse 
events occurring between baseline and week 75. 
An independent external event adjudication com -
mittee reviewed selected adverse events (cardio -
vascular events and acute pancreatitis) and deaths. 
All standard assays were performed in a central 
laboratory.Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 1950 participants provided an 
effective power of 99% for the coprimary and 
confirmatory secondary end points, tested in a 
prespecified hierarchical order. Efficacy end points 
were analyzed in the full analysis population (all 
randomly assigned participants according to the 
intention-to-treat principle); safety end points 
were analyzed in the safety analysis population 
(all randomly assigned participants exposed to 
at least one dose of semaglutide or placebo). 
Observation periods included the in-trial period 
(the time from random assignment to last con -
tact with a trial site, regardless of treatment 
discontinuation or rescue intervention) and the 
on-treatment period. All results from statistical 
analyses were accompanied by a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval and corresponding P values 
(with significance defined as P<0.05). Supportive 
secondary end-point analyses were not controlled 
for multiple comparisons and should not be 
used to infer definitive treatment effects.
Two estimands — the treatment policy esti -
mand (traditional intention-to-treat analysis, with 
effects assessed regardless of treatment discontin -
uation or rescue intervention) and the trial product 
estimand (effects assessed if the drug or placebo 
was taken as intended) — were used to assess 
treatment efficacy from different perspectives and 
accounted for intercurrent events and missing data 
differently, as described previously.16 All analyses 
in the statistical hierarchy were based on the pri -
mary treatment policy estimand (details on analy -
sis methods are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix). All reported results are for the treat -
ment policy estimand, unless stated otherwise.
Results
Study Participants
From June through November 2018, a total of 
1961 participants were randomly assigned to re -
ceive semaglutide (1306 participants) or placebo 
(655 participants). Overall, 94.3% of the partici -
pants completed the trial, 91.2% had a body-
weight assessment at week 68, and 81.1% ad -
hered to treatment (Fig. S2). Rescue interventions 
were received by 7 participants in the semaglutide 
group (2 had bariatric surgery and 5 received other 
antiobesity medication) and by 13 in the placebo 
group (3 had bariatric surgery and 10 received 
other antiobesity medication).

and 1D, and Table S2). Among the participants 
for whom data were available at the week 68 visit 
(1212 participants in the semaglutide group and 
577 in the placebo group), these thresholds were 
reached by 86.4% (1047 participants), 69.1% (838

product estimand are provided in Table S2.Other Confirmatory and Supportive 
Secondary End Points
Semaglutide was associated with greater reduc -
tions from baseline than placebo in waist circum -
ference (–13.54 cm with semaglutide vs. –4.13 cm 
with placebo; estimated treatment difference, 
–9.42 cm; 95% CI, –10.30 to –8.53), BMI (–5.54 
with semaglutide vs. –0.92 with placebo; estimated 
treatment difference, –4.61; 95% CI, –4.96 to 
–4.27), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
at week 68 (Table 2, Table S2, and Figs. S5 and 
S6). Benefits favoring semaglutide were also not -
ed with respect to changes in glycated hemoglo -
bin, fasting plasma glucose, C-reactive protein, 
and fasting lipid levels (Table 2).
Exploratory End Points
Among participants with prediabetes at baseline, 
semaglutide was associated with improvements 
in glycated hemoglobin levels at week 68, and 
84.1% of participants in the semaglutide group 
who had prediabetes at baseline, as compared with 
47.8% of participants in the placebo group with 
prediabetes at baseline, reverted to normogly -
cemia. Results for these and other selected ex -
ploratory end points are presented in Table 2 and 
Table S3.
Physical Functioning and Other  
Participant-Reported Outcomes
SF-36 physical functioning scores (with possible 
norm-based scores ranging from 19.03 to 57.60) 
improved significantly more with semaglutide 
than with placebo at week 68 (P<0.001), and both 
SF-36 physical and mental component summary 
scores favored semaglutide (Table 2, Table S2, 
and Fig. S7). IWQOL-Lite-CT physical function 
scores improved significantly more with sema -
glutide than with placebo at week 68 (P<0.001) 
(Table 2 and Table S2), and there were favorable 
effects over placebo on IWQOL-Lite-CT total 
scores. The results of SF-36 and IWQOL-Lite-CT 
assessments showed that participants were more 
likely to have clinically meaningful within-per -
son improvements in physical functioning with 
semaglutide than with placebo (Table S4).
Change in Body Composition
In the DXA subpopulation (140 participants), total 
fat mass and regional visceral fat mass were re -
duced from baseline with semaglutide (Table S5). 
Although total lean body mass decreased in ab -Figure 1 (facing page). Effect of Once-Weekly Semaglutide,

ages were based on the number of participants for 
whom data were available at the week 68 visit — 1212 
participants in the semaglutide group and 577 in the 
placebo group during the in-trial observation period 
and 1059 participants in the semaglutide group and 
499 in the placebo group during the on-treatment ob -
servation period.

Safety and Side-Effect Profile
Similar percentages of participants in the sema -
glutide and placebo groups reported adverse events 
(89.7% and 86.4%, respectively) (Table 3). Gastro -
intestinal disorders (typically nausea, diarrhea, 
vomiting, and constipation) were the most fre -
quently reported events and occurred in more 
participants receiving semaglutide than those 
receiving placebo (74.2% vs. 47.9%). Most gastro -
intestinal events were mild-to-moderate in sever -
ity, were transient, and resolved without perma -
nent discontinuation of the regimen (Fig. S8).
Serious adverse events were reported in 9.8% 
and 6.4% of semaglutide and placebo partici -
pants, respectively (Table 3), with the difference 
due primarily to a difference between the groups 
in the incidence of serious gastrointestinal dis -
orders (1.4% of participants in the semaglutide 
group and 0% in the placebo group) and hepa -
tobiliary disorders (1.3% with semaglutide and 
0.2% with placebo). More participants in the 
semaglutide group than in the placebo group 
(7.0% vs. 3.1%) discontinued treatment owing to 
adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal events) 
(Table 3 and Fig. S9). One death was reported in 
each group, with neither considered by the inde -
pendent external event adjudication committee 
to be related to receipt of semaglutide or placebo 
(Table  3).
Gallbladder-related disorders (mostly choleli -
thiasis) were reported in 2.6% and 1.2% of par -
ticipants in the semaglutide and placebo groups, 
respectively. Mild acute pancreatitis (according 
to the Atlanta classification18) was reported in 
three participants in the semaglutide group (one 
participant had a history of acute pancreatitis, 
and the other two participants had both gall -
stones and pancreatitis); all recovered during the 
trial period. There was no difference between 
groups in the incidence of benign and malignant 
neoplasms. Additional safety variables are de -
scribed in Table 3 and Table S6.

*  The treatment policy estimand assesses treatment effect regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention; see Table S2 for corresponding data for the estimand (which 
assessed treatment effect assuming all participants adhered to treatment and did not receive rescue intervention). Continuous end-point analyses were conducted with the use of the

categorical end points were conducted with the use of logistic regression, with the same factor and covariate.

*  Adverse events are shown for the safety analysis population (all randomly assigned participants exposed to at least one dose of trial drug or 
placebo); since all participants received at least one dose of drug or placebo, the safety population is the same as the full-analysis population. 
Included are all adverse events that occurred during the on-treatment period (i.e., the period during which any dose of semaglutide or pla-
cebo was administered within the previous 49 days, with any period of temporary interruption of a regimen excluded), unless indicated oth-
erwise. Adverse events were classified by severity as mild (causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities), moderate 
(causing sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal everyday activities), or severe (preventing normal everyday activities).
†  Included are events that were observed during the in-trial period (the time from random assignment to last contact with a trial site, re-
gardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention).
‡  In the semaglutide group, sudden cardiac death occurred in one participant with a medical history of hypertension and obstructive sleep 
apnea who had discontinued semaglutide. In the placebo group, death due to glioblastoma, aspiration pneumonia, and severe sepsis oc-
curred in one participant each who had discontinued placebo.
§  Shown are the most common adverse events, according to the preferred term in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA), version 22.1, reported in 10% or more of participants in either treatment group.
¶  On the basis of therapeutic experience with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and regulatory feedback and requirements, a num-
ber of safety focus areas were prespecified as being of special interest in the safety evaluation. Identified through searches of MedDRA, 
these preferred terms were judged to be relevant for each of the safety focus areas.

n engl j med 384;11 nejm.org March 18, 2021 999Semaglutide in Adults with Overweight or Obesity
a mean weight loss of 14.9% from baseline with 
semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle interven -
tion. This loss exceeded that with placebo plus 
lifestyle intervention by 12.4 percentage points. 
The 14.9% mean weight loss that we observed in 
the semaglutide group is substantially greater 
than the weight loss of 4.0 to 10.9% from base -
line with approved antiobesity medications.3,19 
Moreover, 86% of participants who received 
semaglutide, as compared with 32% of those who 
received placebo, lost 5% or more of baseline 
body weight, a widely used criterion of clinically 
meaningful response.2,3,20,21 Weight loss with sema -
glutide stems from a reduction in energy intake 
owing to decreased appetite, which is thought to 
result from direct and indirect effects on the 
brain.22-25 Weight loss with semaglutide was ac -
companied by greater improvements than placebo 
with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors, in -
cluding reductions in waist circumference, blood 
pressure, glycated hemoglobin levels, and lipid 
levels; a greater decrease from baseline in C-reac -
tive protein, a marker of inflammation; and a 
greater proportion of participants with normo -
glycemia. Semaglutide also improved physical 
functioning, as assessed by SF-36 and IWQOL-
Lite-CT, a finding that is notable given that over -
weight and obesity significantly impair health-
related quality of life.26 Statistical superiority of 
semaglutide over placebo was achieved for all 
end points in the hierarchical testing procedure.
Weight loss of 10 to 15% (or more) is recom -
mended in people with many complications of 
overweight and obesity (e.g., prediabetes, hyper -
tension, and obstructive sleep apnea).1,20,21,27 In 
the semaglutide group, approximately 70% of 
participants achieved a weight loss of at least 10%, 
and approximately 50% achieved a weight loss of 
at least 15%. Furthermore, one third of partici -
pants treated with semaglutide lost at least 20% 
of baseline weight, a reduction approaching that 
reported 1 to 3 years after bariatric surgery, par -
ticularly sleeve gastrectomy (approximately 20 to 
30% weight loss).28-31 The magnitude of reduc -
tion in cardiometabolic risk is assumed to be pro -
portional to the amount of weight lost with both 
approaches (i.e., pharmacotherapy or surgery).32
Analyses from the DXA substudy suggested 
that semaglutide led to greater reduction in fat 
mass than lean body mass, a finding consistent 
with previous findings with semaglutide (at a dose 
of 1.0 mg) in persons with obesity22 and in those with type 2 diabetes.33 The weight loss and im -
provements with respect to cardiometabolic risk 
factors with semaglutide reported here will be 
complemented by an ongoing cardiovascular 
outcomes trial in participants with overweight 
or obesity and established cardiovascular disease 
(the SELECT trial; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT03574597).
Liraglutide administered subcutaneously once 
daily is the only GLP-1 receptor agonist approved 
for weight management.3,19,34 Our trial showed 
greater mean placebo-corrected weight reductions 
with once-weekly 2.4-mg semaglutide plus life -
style intervention (12.4%) than those reported with 
once-daily 3.0-mg liraglutide plus lifestyle in -
tervention in the 56-week SCALE (Satiety and 
Clinical Adiposity — Liraglutide Evidence in Non -
diabetic and Diabetic Individuals Obesity and Pre -
diabetes) trial (4.5%).34,35 In addition, the weight-
loss phase with semaglutide persisted longer than 
that reported with liraglutide35 and did not reach 
the nadir until week 60. However, these two stud -
ies differed in their participant population, which 
limits the robustness of between-study com -
parisons.
At week 68, 31% of participants who received 
placebo had lost at least 5% of baseline body 
weight, with 12% and 5% having achieved reduc -
tions of at least 10% and at least 15%, respectively, 
findings that show good adherence to lifestyle 
interventions. Similar results were observed at 
week 56 in the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes 
trial.35
Currently, approved antiobesity drugs require 
administration once, twice, or three times daily,3,19 
and a once-weekly regimen may improve treat -
ment adherence. The once-weekly 2.4-mg dose of 
semaglutide was chosen for the present study on 
the basis of pharmacokinetic modeling that sug -
gested that the 2.4-mg weekly dose had a maxi -
mum steady-state concentration similar to a 
once-daily 0.4-mg dose investigated in a phase 
2 dose-finding trial in participants with obesi -
ty.14 The results of our study with once-weekly 
semaglutide at a 2.4-mg dose are consistent with 
the results of the phase 2 study, which showed 
an 11.6% greater reduction in body weight with 
once-daily semaglutide at a dose of 0.4 mg than 
with placebo after 52 weeks of treatment.14
The safety of semaglutide was consistent with 
that reported in the phase 2 study with once-
daily dosing in participants with obesity14 and in

the trials of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglu -
tide in persons with type 2 diabetes (involving 
more than 8000 participants receiving doses up 
to 1 mg),12 as well as with that reported for the 
GLP-1 receptor agonist class in general.13,36 As is 
typical of this drug class,13,37 transient, mild-to-
moderate gastrointestinal disorders were the most 
frequently reported adverse events, and more par -
ticipants in the semaglutide group than in the 
placebo group discontinued the assigned regimen 
after such events. Nausea was the most common 
gastrointestinal event, occurring primarily during 
the dose-escalation period, a finding similar to 
that reported with liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg.35 
Gallbladder-related disorders, principally chole -
lithiasis, were more common in the semaglutide 
group, a finding consistent with previous re -
ports for GLP-1 receptor agonists38,39 and with 
the known effects of rapid weight loss.40,41 The 
incidence of cholelithiasis with semaglutide was 
in line with that of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg.35 
No new safety concerns arose.
Strengths of this trial included the large sam -
ple size and high rates of adherence to the treat -
ment regimen and completion of the trial. Limi -
tations included the preponderance of women 
and White participants, the relatively short dura -
tion of the trial, the exclusion of persons with 
type 2 diabetes, and the potential that partici -
pants who were enrolled may represent a sub -
group with greater commitment to weight-loss 
efforts than the general population. Although 
the DXA data we report provide greater insight 
into the weight-loss effects of semaglutide, such 
assessments were performed in only a subpopu -
lation of participants.
Our trial showed that among adults with 
overweight or obesity (without diabetes), once-
weekly subcutaneous semaglutide plus lifestyle 
intervention was associated with substantial, 
sustained, clinically relevant mean weight loss of 
14.9%, with 86% of participants attaining at 
least 5% weight loss.
