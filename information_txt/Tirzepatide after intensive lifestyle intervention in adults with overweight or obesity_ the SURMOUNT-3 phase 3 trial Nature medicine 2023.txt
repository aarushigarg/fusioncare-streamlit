The effects of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide 
and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on weight reduction after successful intensive lifestyle intervention are unknown. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized (1:1) adults with body mass index  ≥30 or ≥27 kg/m
2 and at least one obesity-related complication (excluding 
diabetes), who achieved ≥5.0% weight reduction after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention, to tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose (10 or 15 mg)  or placebo once weekly for 72 weeks (n = 579). The treatment regimen estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment adherence in the intention-  
to-treat population. The coprimary endpoint of additional mean per cent weight change from randomization to week 72 was met with changes  of −18.4% (standard error (s.e.) 0.7) with tirzepatide and 2.5% (s.e. 1.0)  with placebo (estimated treatment difference −20.8 percentage points  (95% confidence interval (CI) −23.2%, −18.5%; P < 0.001). The coprimary 
endpoint of the percentage of participants achieving additional weight reduction ≥5% was met with 87.5% (s.e. 2.2) with tirzepatide and 16.5%  (s.e. 3.0) with placebo achieving this threshold (odds ratio 34.6%; 95% CI 19.2%, 62.6%; P < 0.001). The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were gastrointestinal, with most being mild to moderate in severity. Tirzepatide provided substantial additional reduction in body weight in participants who had achieved ≥5.0% weight reduction with intensive lifestyle intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04657016 .
The adverse effects of obesity are well known to healthcare profes -
sionals and persons who live with this chronic disease1–4, as are the 
benefits of weight reduction. Decreasing baseline body weight by 5–10% 
reduces the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes while also improv -
ing cardiometabolic risk factors (for example, blood pressure) and 
other obesity-related complications (for example, osteoarthritis)5–8.
Intensive lifestyle intervention is recommended as the corner -
stone of obesity management3,5,8–10. It consists of a reduced-calorie diet (for example, 1,200–1,500 kcal per day based on weight or sex), physi -
cal activity (≥150 min per week) and frequent behavioral counseling 
(for example, ≥14 sessions over 6 months), and induces mean reduc -
tions of 5–8% of baseline weight with accompanying improvements 
in health5. Its overall effectiveness, however, is limited by two factors. 
Large weight reductions are critical for achieving optimal control of 
obesity-related complications (for example, obstructive sleep apnea 
and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis)6–8 and decreasing cardiovascular Received: 18 August 2023

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02597-wExpert panels have suggested the use of antiobesity medica -
tions following intensive lifestyle intervention to induce additional 
weight reduction (which may be needed to achieve optimal control of 
obesity-related complications) or, at a minimum, to prevent weight 
regain5,7,9,10. The present trial evaluated the efficacy of tirzepatide at 
72 weeks postrandomization in adults with obesity or overweight (but 
not diabetes) who successfully lost ≥5% of baseline weight during a 
12-week lead-in period that provided intensive lifestyle intervention.
Results
Patient disposition
Intensive lifestyle intervention lead-in period . A total of 972   
participants were assessed for eligibility at screening, of whom 806 
were enrolled into the 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention lead-in 
period (Fig. 1 ). The first participant was enrolled on 12 April 2021  
and the last on 3 September 2021. The key demographics and clinical 
characteristics of these participants have previously been published28.
Of the 806 participants enrolled, 579 (71.8%) who achieved ≥5% 
weight reduction at the end of the lead-in period and were otherwise 
eligible to proceed to the next phase of the study were randomized to 
either tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose (MTD, n  = 287) or placebo 
(n = 292) (Fig. 1). Mean body weight and body mass index (BMI) in these 
579 participants decreased from 109.5 kg and 38.6 kg/m2, respectively, 
at screening to 101.9 kg and 35.9 kg/m2, respectively, at randomiza -
tion, representing an average 6.9% reduction in body weight after the 
12-week intensive lifestyle intervention (Table 1 ). Weight reduction 
during lead-in was accompanied by reductions in waist circumference, mortality11– 14, but <20% of patients treated with lifestyle interven -
tions lose ≥15% of baseline weight15. Patients also regain one-third of 
lost weight in the year following treatment, with increasing weight 
regain over time5,16. Weight regain after diet and exercise intervention 
is attributable, in part, to persistent metabolic adaptations in which 
patients’ hunger hormones increase, satiety hormones decrease and 
energy expenditure declines out of proportion to the amount of weight 
lost17–19 such that an even lower energy intake is needed to maintain the 
weight-reduced state.
New incretin-based, antiobesity medications could bolster the 
results of intensive lifestyle intervention20. Semaglutide 2.4 mg is a 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, originally approved 
at a lower dose for control of type 2 diabetes and which, in persons 
with obesity or overweight (but not diabetes), reduces baseline body 
weight by 15% at up to 2 years (versus 2–3% for placebo)21,22. It decreases 
energy intake principally by modification of hunger and satiety sign -
aling in select neural regions21. Tirzepatide is a single molecule that 
combines glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 
receptor agonism23 to exert synergistic effects on appetite (for example,  
hunger and satiety), energy intake and metabolic function24–26. It is 
approved in many geographies including the USA, European Union 
and Japan as a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable for type 2 diabetes 
and is currently under review for chronic weight management26–28. In 
the SURMOUNT-1 trial, patients with obesity or overweight (but not 
diabetes) who received tirzepatide 15 mg, with monthly brief lifestyle 
counseling, lost 20.9% of baseline weight at 72 weeks (versus 3.1% for pla -
cebo) with accompanying reductions in cardiometabolic risk factors27.35 (12.2%) discontinued study

and free fatty acids (Table 1 ).
Tirzepatide versus placebo postrandomization . The majority of the 
579 randomized participants were white (86.0%) and female (62.9%), 
with an overall mean age of 45.6 years (Table 2 ). The average dura -
tion of obesity was 15.1 years, and 66.1% had a medical history of one 
or more obesity-related complications. Demographics and clinical 
characteristics at randomization (week 0), as well as weight reduc -
tion and cardiometabolic changes during the lead-in period, were  
similar across the tirzepatide MTD (10 or 15 mg) and placebo groups 
(Tables 1 and 2 and Extended Data Table 1).
Of the 579 randomized participants, 479 (82.7%) completed the 
study (87.8% on tirzepatide MTD and 77.7% on placebo) and 429 (74.1%) 
completed the study on treatment (78.7% on tirzepatide MTD and 69.5% on placebo). The most common reasons for discontinuation of study 
treatment were adverse event (10.5%, detailed in Table 3 ) and with -
drawal by subject (6.3%) in the tirzepatide MTD group, and withdrawal 
by subject (14.4%) and lost to follow-up (6.5%) in the placebo group.
In tirzepatide-treated participants, 248 (86.4%) had a tirzepatide 
MTD of 15 mg. In this study, all randomized participants took at least 
one dose of the study intervention (tirzepatide MTD or placebo). There -
fore, the intention-to-treat population is the same as the modified 
intention-to-treat population.
Primary outcomes
Figure 2a,b shows the mean percentage reduction in body weight 
from randomization to week 72. For the treatment regimen estimand 
(TRE) the mean change at week 72 was −18.4% (s.e. 0.7) with tirzepatide 
MTD and 2.5% (s.e. 1.0) with placebo. Tirzepatide MTD was superior to 
placebo, with an estimated treatment difference relative to placebo 
of −20.8 percentage points (95% CI −23.2, −18.5; P  < 0.001) (Table 4 ). Table 1 | Clinical characteristics and changes during intensive lifestyle intervention lead-in period

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02597-wThe mean change in body weight for the efficacy estimand was −21.1% 
(s.e. 0.6) with tirzepatide MTD and 3.3% (s.e. 0.6) with placebo. The 
estimated treatment difference was −24.5 percentage points (95% CI 
−26.1, −22.8; P < 0.001) for tirzepatide MTD versus placebo. Absolute 
body weight over time is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1.
For the TRE, 87.5% (251) of participants in the tirzepatide MTD 
group lost an additional ≥5% of body weight from randomization to 
week 72 compared with 16.5% (48) in the placebo group (odds ratio (OR) 
34.6 (95% CI 19.2, 62.6); P  < 0.001) (Fig. 2c and Table 4 ). For the efficacy 
estimand, 94.4% (268) of participants in the tirzepatide MTD group 
had an additional body weight reduction of ≥5% from randomization 
compared with 10.7% (31) in the placebo group (OR 130.4 (95% CI 70.0, 
242.8); P < 0.001) (Fig. 2d).
Secondary outcomes
Change in body weight.  At week 72, more participants on tirzepatide 
MTD than placebo achieved reductions in body weight of ≥10, ≥15 and 
≥20% from randomization (P < 0.001; Fig. 2c,d and Table 4 ).
At 72 weeks, for the TRE, 94.0% (270) of participants in the tirze-
patide MTD group maintained ≥80% of body weight lost during  
the 12-week lead-in period compared with 43.8% (128) in the placebo 
group (OR 19.7; 95% CI 10.3, 37.6; P  < 0.001; Fig. 2e and Table 4 ). For the  
efficacy estimand, 98.6% (280) of participants in the tirzepatide MTD 
group met this endpoint compared with 37.8% (110) in the placebo 
group (OR 101.6; 95% CI 39.2, 263.6; P < 0.001; Fig. 2e).
Overall, for the TRE, intensive lifestyle intervention followed by 
72 weeks of tirzepatide led to a total weight change of −24.3% compared 
with −4.5% with intensive lifestyle intervention followed by placebo 
(estimated treatment difference −19.9 percentage points (95% CI −23.5, 
−16.2) (Fig. 2f). For the efficacy estimand, intensive lifestyle interven-
tion followed by 72 weeks of tirzepatide led to a total weight change 
of –26.6% compared with −3.8% with intensive lifestyle intervention 
followed by placebo (estimated treatment difference −22.8 percentage 
points (95% CI −24.3, −21.2; Fig. 2f and Extended Data Table 2).
Accordingly, there was a reduction in BMI with tirzepatide com-
pared with placebo from randomization to week 72 (efficacy estimand: 
tirzepatide, −7.7 kg/m2 versus placebo, 1.2 kg/m2; estimated treatment 
difference −8.9 kg/m2 (95% CI −9.6, −8.3; Table 4). Total change in BMI 
with intensive lifestyle intervention followed by 72 weeks of tirzepatide 
MTD was −10.4 kg/m2 compared with –1.4 kg/m2 with intensive lifestyle 
intervention followed by placebo (efficacy estimand: estimated treat -
ment difference −8.9 kg/m2 (95% CI −9.6, −8.3; Extended Data Table 2).
Cardiometabolic risk factors and physical function. At week 72 the 
change from randomization in waist circumference with tirzepatide 
MTD was superior to placebo using the TRE (tirzepatide, −14.6 cm  
versus placebo, 0.2 cm; estimated treatment difference, −14.8 cm  
(95% CI −17.2, −12.5; P  < 0.001; Table 4 ). Results were consistent for 
the efficacy estimand (tirzepatide, −16.8 cm versus placebo, 1.1 cm; 
estimated treatment difference −17.9 cm (95% CI −19.5, −16.3; P  < 0.001). 
Improvements with tirzepatide MTD, from randomization to week 72, 
were greater versus placebo in both systolic blood pressure (tirze -
patide, −5.1 mmHg versus placebo, 4.1 mmHg; estimated treatment 
difference −9.2 mmHg (−11.2, −7.2) and diastolic blood pressure (tirze -
patide, −3.2 mmHg versus placebo, 2.3 mmHg; estimated treatment 
difference −5.5 mmHg (−6.9, −4.1) using the efficacy estimand (Table 4  
and Extended Data Fig. 2). Treatment with tirzepatide MTD resulted in 
further improvements across all fasting lipid levels (HDL, LDL, VLDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids), glycemic control 
(fasting glucose and HbA1c) and fasting insulin compared with placebo 
at 72 weeks from randomization (Table 4 ). In addition, 4.9 and 2.8% of 
participants in the tirzepatide group compared with 1.0 and 1.7% of 
participants in the placebo group were reported as having a decrease in 
intensity of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, respec -
tively. Conversely, 2.4 and 0.3% of participants in the tirzepatide group Table 2 | Baseline characteristics (at randomization) in all

hypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies, respectively, compared 
with 6.5 and 2.1% of participants in the placebo group.
Participant-reported physical function improved more with tirze -
patide than with placebo from randomization to week 72 (Table 4 ). 
This was observed with both the physical functioning domain score 
for Short Form-36v.2 Health Survey (SF-36v2) (tirzepatide, 3.3 versus 
placebo, −0.6; estimated treatment difference 3.9 (95% CI 2.8, 4.9)) 
and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite-Clinical Trials Version 
(IWQOL-Lite-CT) physical function composite score (tirzepatide, 13.9 
versus placebo, 1.1; estimated treatment difference 12.8 (95% CI 9.7, 
16.0)) using the efficacy estimand.
Changes in cardiometabolic parameters and patient-reported 
outcomes from the start of the lead-in period (week −12) to week 72 
are reported in Extended Data Table 2.
Safety
Overall, 87.1% of the 287 tirzepatide-treated participants reported at 
least one treatment-emergent adverse event compared with 76.7% of 
the 292 placebo-treated participants (Table 3 ). The most frequently 
reported adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea  
and constipation). These occurred in more participants in the tirze-
patide MTD group than placebo, were mostly mild to moderate in 
severity and occurred primarily during dose escalation (Extended 
Data Fig. 3). Antiemetic medication use was reported by 78 par -
ticipants (27.2%) treated with tirzepatide and by 20 (6.8%) treated  
with placebo. Anti diarrheal medication use was reported by 23  
participants (8.0%) treated with tirzepatide and by six (2.1%) treated 
with placebo.
Serious adverse events were reported by 31 participants (5.4%) 
overall. Occurrence was similar in participants treated with tirzepa -
tide (5.9%) and placebo (4.8%) (Table 3). Two deaths (both myocardial 
infarction) were reported during the study, one in the tirzepatide MTD 
group and one in the placebo group. Both events were considered not 
to be related to the study treatment by the investigator.
Adjudication-confirmed cases of pancreatitis were reported in 
0.3% (one) of participants in the tirzepatide MTD group and 0.3% (one) 
of participants in the placebo group from randomization to safety 
follow-up (Table 3 ). Cholelithiasis was reported in 1.4% (four) of par -
ticipants in the tirzepatide group and 1.0% (three) of participants in the 
placebo group. There was one case (0.3%) of acute cholecystitis in the tirzepatide group and none in the placebo group. Malignancies were 
reported in 1.7% (five) of participants in the tirzepatide MTD group 
and 1.0% (three) of participants in the placebo group. None of the 
malignancies were considered related to the study treatment by the 
investigators, and no cases of medullary thyroid cancer or pancreatic 
cancer were reported. Additional safety measures are reported in

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02597-wExploratory outcomes
For the prespecified exploratory endpoint of achieving ≥25% body 
weight reduction from randomization, for the TRE, 28.7% (82)  
of tirzepatide-treated participants compared with 1.2% (four) in the 
placebo group met this target (OR 33.7 (95% CI 8.8, 128.5); Table 4 ). 
Results were consistent for the efficacy estimand (tirzepatide, 36.3% 
versus placebo, 0.3%; OR 124.6 (95% CI 24.9, 623.2); Fig. 2d).
Discussion
Tirzepatide substantially increased the magnitude of weight loss when 
administered following an initial 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention 
that reduced baseline body weight by an average of 6.9% in successful program completers. As measured from randomization (week 0) to 
week 72, participants who received tirzepatide MTD of 10 or 15 mg lost 
an additional 18.4% of body weight, compared with a gain of 2.5% for 
placebo. In total, 87.5% of tirzepatide-treated participants lost an addi -
tional 5% or more of their randomization weight compared with 16.5% 
of placebo-treated participants, with tirzepatide also demonstrating 
superiority in the achievement of all other categorical weight losses. 
These findings indicate that individuals with overweight or obesity who 
have lost approximately 5–10% of their body weight with supervised 
lifestyle intervention—or potentially through their own self-directed 
diet and exercise efforts—could expect to achieve further clinically 
meaningful weight loss with the addition of tirzepatide.Table 4 | Efficacy findings from randomization (week 0) to week 72

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02597-wThe strength of tirzepatide is underscored by comparison with a 
similarly designed trial of liraglutide (3.0 mg), approved for chronic 
weight management. After losing an average 6.0% of baseline weight 
in a comparable lead-in program, participants who received liraglutide 
achieved an additional 6.2% reduction in randomization weight at 
56 weeks compared with a 0.2% reduction for placebo29. The liraglu -
tide trial provided a total of 17 lifestyle counseling sessions during the 
medication phase of the study compared with only quarterly visits in 
the present trial. This decreased frequency of counseling visits could explain the greater weight regain in the placebo group in the present 
study. The only other similarly designed trial of a medication approved 
for chronic weight management found that orlistat (120 mg three times 
daily) was not effective in inducing additional weight loss over 1 year 
when administered following an average 11.0% reduction achieved with 
intensive lifestyle intervention30. Patients treated by both orlistat and 
placebo regained one-third or more of their lost weight. Tirzepatide 
was also superior to placebo on a traditional measure of weight loss 
maintenance—the proportion of participants who maintained a prede -
fined percentage of their initial weight loss. In the present study, 94% of tirzepatide-treated participants, compared with 44% of those who 
received placebo, maintained ≥80% of their weight loss achieved in the 
lead-in period. These results compare favorably with those achieved 
with both liraglutide and orlistat but perhaps, more importantly, with 
the results of traditional lifestyle intervention. Individuals who receive 
such intervention typically regain one-third of their lost weight in 
the year following treatment completion31. Regain can be decreased 
to 10–15% at 1 year with participation in a weight loss maintenance 
program, offered in person or by phone, which provides continued 
lifestyle counseling on a monthly or more frequent basis32. However, 
after 2.5 years of such monthly phone-based counseling only 45% of 
participants maintained ≥4 kg of an original mean 8.5 kg loss achieved 
during a 6 month lead-in period33. These findings reveal the potential 
benefits of tirzepatide, relative to traditional weight loss maintenance 
counseling, in not only sustaining weight reduction achieved with 
intensive lifestyle intervention but in adding to it. Long-term compara -
tive studies for weight loss maintenance are needed.
The cumulative 24.3% reduction in body weight achieved with 
intensive lifestyle intervention, followed by tirzepatide, approximates 
the 1 year weight loss induced with sleeve gastrectomy34. The overall 
BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 represents a downward shift of about two 
BMI categories. Participants treated with lifestyle interventions have long sought to achieve a similar magnitude of weight loss, principally 
to improve their health and quality of life35,36. Tirzepatide enhanced 
the improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors that were achieved 
in the lead-in period. Systolic and diastolic BP improved by an addi -
tional −5.1 and −3.2 mmHg, respectively, lipids parameters improved 
by an additional −3% to −26% and fasting insulin further declined by 
39%. Self-reported physical function improved by 3.3 points on the 
SF-36v2 physical functioning domain score and by 13.9 points on the 
IWQOL-Lite-CT physical function composite. These improvements 
underscore the additional benefits that patients may receive from 
treatment with tirzepatide after first losing weight with intensive life-style intervention, or potentially with their own self-directed diet and 
activity programs. By contrast, many of the cardiometabolic improve -
ments achieved during the lead-in reverted toward baseline in the 
placebo group.
The safety profile of tirzepatide in this trial was consistent with 
findings from previous trials of tirzepatide when evaluated for the 
treatment of obesity27,37 or type 2 diabetes38, as well as with the safety 
profile of the GLP-1 receptor agonist class in patients with obesity or 
overweight39,40. Mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal events were the 
most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events, mostly transient 
and occurring during dose escalation. Compared with the tirzepatide 
15 mg group in SURMOUNT-1, the tirzepatide group in this study had 
modestly higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Other trials that combined 
intensive lifestyle intervention with pharmacotherapy have also shown 
higher rates of gastrointestinal events compared with trials inves -
tigating pharmacotherapy without intensive lifestyle intervention 
(for example, STEP-3 compared with STEP-1 for semaglutide 2.4 mg 
and SCALE-MAINTENANCE compared with SCALE for liraglutide 
3.0 mg)21,29,41,42. It has been speculated that caloric restriction could 
lead to a reduction in GLP-1 and other gastrointestinal satiety hor -
mones43. Whether this worsens initial gastrointestinal tolerability to 
incretin-based therapy and is a possible explanation for the observed findings requires further investigation.
Much remains to be learned about how lifestyle intervention and 
the new incretin-based antiobesity medications can be optimally used 
together. If the goal of combining these therapies is to increase total 
weight loss, results of the present trial and SCALE-MAINTENANCE29 
suggest that introducing the intensive lifestyle intervention first (for 
approximately 12 weeks) followed by the addition of medication, as 
in the present study, could maximize weight reduction. The weight 
reduction observed with tirzepatide MTD in the 72 week, double-blind 
period of the current trial was similar to that achieved with tirzepatide 
10 and 15 mg over 72 weeks in the SURMOUNT-1 study. Therefore, the 
sequential use of these interventions appeared to produce additive 
weight loss that approached the combined results of each intervention 
used alone. However, providing intensive lifestyle intervention and 
medication concurrently, rather than sequentially, has not achieved 
the same degree of additive benefit in placebo-controlled trials41,44. For 
example, the concurrent provision of intensive lifestyle intervention 
(plus meal replacements) and semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP-3 trial 
produced a mean weight loss of 16.0%, which was comparable to that 
observed in the STEP-1 study (14.9%) in a similar population that did not 
receive this enhanced intensive lifestyle intervention21,41.
The suggestion of additivity with sequential therapy, however, 
may be challenged by findings from preclinical studies. These studies 
have demonstrated that caloric restriction alone does not address 
the underlying physiology regulating body weight or fat mass, and 
antiobesity medication has the same overall ultimate effect regardless 
of whether or not caloric restriction preceded the medication45. This 
implies that, if weight reduction in the lead-in period of the present 
trial was due only to a volitional reduction in caloric intake, the overall 
weight reduction of 24.3% could represent the effect the drug would 
have had even without an intensive lifestyle lead-in. Indeed, a recent 
88 week trial of tirzepatide has demonstrated this degree of weight 
reduction as early as 52 weeks on treatment46. The reason the weight 
reduction in the present trial may be higher than that observed in 
SURMOUNT-1 could be related to differences in demographics between 
the trial populations, or to the fact that this study, and other similarly 
designed trials, preselected for a highly responsive population by randomization of only participants who achieved an initial reduc
-
tion of 5% or more with intensive lifestyle intervention. It is possible 
that participants who respond to lifestyle intervention are simply 
more responsive to tirzepatide. Further analyses should help examine  
this hypothesis.
Another major treatment issue concerns the intensity (that is, 
frequency) and scope of lifestyle intervention required with antiobes -
ity medications. Weekly lifestyle visits and daily monitoring of food 
and energy intake historically have been required to help patients 
achieve and maintain the 500–750 kcal per day deficit needed to induce 
clinically meaningful weight loss16. Semaglutide and tirzepatide both 
appear to physiologically drive this reduction in energy intake, which 
might enable patients to implement dietary behavior changes with 
greater ease and efficiency than conventional lifestyle counseling. 
Similarly, weight loss induced with antiobesity medication, with the 
accompanying improvement in physical function observed in the pre -
sent study, could increase patients’ ease in engaging in physical activity,  
thus potentially further improving their cardiometabolic health.

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02597-wThe strengths of this study, which included an intensive lifestyle 
lead-in, include the fact that it had a relatively large sample size in 
which over one-third of the randomized population were men and 
over half were of Hispanic ethnicity. In addition, a 72-week treatment 
period facilitated at least 52 weeks of treatment with tirzepatide at 
MTD. The allowance of dose de- and re-escalation during the titration 
phase helped to maximize tolerability and reflected dose adjustment strategies that may be relevant for clinical practice.
The study’s limitations include that it was geographically restricted 
to North and South America and that the study population was pre -
dominantly white, thus potentially limiting the generalizability of the 
findings. In addition, the 17.5% of participants who did not lose at least 
5% of baseline weight in the intensive lifestyle intervention were not 
randomized to medication. To the extent that response to lifestyle 
intervention may predict response to medication, exclusion of these 
participants may have resulted in a higher mean weight loss with tirze -
patide MTD than would have been observed if lifestyle nonresponders 
had been included. Trials of the response to antiobesity medications in 
persons who are unsuccessful with intensive lifestyle intervention are needed, because lack of success with lifestyle interventions has been 
a common prerequisite for initiation of pharmacotherapy or bariatric 
surgery. Future studies evaluating both genetic and behavioral predic -
tors of response to lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy will help 
inform clinical management even earlier in the course of treatment.
In conclusion, in the SURMOUNT-3 trial, tirzepatide demonstrated 
clinically meaningful additional body weight reductions in adults 
with overweight or obesity following initial weight loss with intensive lifestyle intervention.

Study design and participants
This 84-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 62 medical research  
centers in the USA, Argentina and Brazil. The study consisted of 
four periods: a 2-week screening period; a 12-week lead-in period 
during which participants received intensive lifestyle intervention 
to achieve ≥5.0% body weight reduction; a 72-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period (including a 20-week dose 
 
escalation period); and a 4-week safety follow-up period (Extended 
Data Fig. 4).
Eligible participants were ≥18 years of age and had obesity 
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2) with at least one 
weight-related complication. Female enrollment was capped at 70% to 
ensure adequate representation of the male population. Full eligibility 
criteria are listed below.
Inclusion criteria
Participants were eligible for inclusion in the study only if all of the 
following criteria applied:
Type of participant and disease characteristics.

questionnaires
Participant characteristics. 
 4. were at least 18 years of age and age of majority according to 
local laws and regulations
 a. male participants:
•	 Male participants with partners of childbearing potential should have been willing to use reliable contraceptive methods throughout the study and for five half-lives of study drug plus 90 days, corresponding to 4 months after the last injection. b. female participants:

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04657016 .  
The protocol was approved by local institutional review boards and  
the trial complied with the International Conference on Harmonization  
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.  
All participants provided written informed consent.Lead-in period
Eligible participants were enrolled in a 12-week intensive lifestyle inter -
vention lead-in period. The lead-in lifestyle intervention included 
frequent in-person lifestyle counseling sessions (that is, eight sessions 
over 12 weeks), delivered by a dietitian or similarly qualified healthcare 
professional. Women were instructed to consume approximately 
1,200 kcal per day and men 1,500 kcal per day. The dietary intervention 
could include up to two meal replacements (liquid meal replacements 
or prepackaged, portion-controlled meals) per day. Participants were 
encouraged to engage in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical 
activity per week (for example, brisk walking). They were counseled on 
behavior modification strategies to help implement and adhere to the 
diet and exercise recommendations, and were encouraged to complete 
3-day diet and exercise logs before each counseling visit.
Randomization for the double-blind treatment period
Participants who achieved ≥5.0% weight reduction at the end of the 
12-week lead-in period were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either the MTD of tirzepatide (10 or 15 mg) or placebo. Assignment to 
treatment group was determined by a computer-generated random 
sequence using a validated interactive web-response system. All par-
ticipants, investigators and the sponsor were masked to treatment 
assignment. To maintain masking of participants and site staff, the 
single-dose pens were identical between active product and placebo. 
Randomization was stratified according to country, sex (female, male) 
and per cent weight reduction at the end of lead-in (<10 versus ≥10%).
Procedures during the double-blind treatment period
Tirzepatide and matched placebo were administered once weekly as 
a subcutaneous injection using a single-dose pen. The starting dose 
of tirzepatide was 2.5 mg, increasing by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until 
an MTD dose of 10 or 15 mg was reached. To optimize tolerability and adherence, gastrointestinal symptoms could be managed by dietary 
counseling, symptomatic medications according to the investigator’s 
discretion or skipping of a single dose of treatment. During the first 
24 weeks of the treatment period, if these mitigations were not suc -
cessful one cycle of tirzepatide dose de- and re-escalation (in 2.5 mg 
increments) was allowed for participants unable to tolerate any dose between 7.5 and 15 mg inclusive; participants unable to tolerate 2.5 or 
5 mg were discontinued from study drug but remained in the study 
for continued follow-up. Participants who did not tolerate up to 10 mg 
even after one de- and re-escalation attempt were discontinued from 
study drug but remained in the study for continued follow-up. Dose 
adjustments were not permitted after the first 24 weeks of treatment.
Throughout the postrandomization period, participants con -
tinued to consult with a dietitian or other qualified healthcare pro -
fessional. Lifestyle counseling sessions occurred every 12 weeks and 
focused on consumption of a healthy balanced diet, with a 500 kcal per 
day deficit and continuation of physical activity. Use of the diet and 
exercise log was encouraged. In between counseling sessions, diet 
and exercise goals were reinforced by site staff at every monthly visit.
Participants were permitted to use concomitant medications that 
they required during the study, except for certain agents specified in the protocol that could interfere with the assessment of efficacy and safety characteristics of the study treatments.
Study outcomes
Coprimary endpoints were per cent change in body weight and the 
proportion of study participants who achieved ≥5% weight reduction 
from randomization to week 72. Key secondary endpoints, controlled 
for type 1 error rate, included the proportion of study participants 
who achieved ≥10, ≥15 or ≥20% weight reduction from randomization to week 72. The proportion of study participants who achieved ≥25% 
reduction in body weight was a prespecified exploratory endpoint. Key 
secondary endpoints also included the proportion of participants who, 

Nature Medicine
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02597-wat week 72, maintained ≥80% of the body weight loss achieved during 
the 12-week lead-in period, as well as change in waist circumference 
(cm) from randomization to week 72.
Additional secondary endpoints included change in anthropo -
metrics (absolute body weight and BMI), cardiometabolic risk factors 
(blood pressure, lipids, fasting glucose, HbA1c and fasting insulin) and 
patient-reported outcomes (the Physical Functioning domain score 
on the SF-36v2 acute form, and the IWQOL-Lite-CT Physical Function 
composite score). These additional secondary endpoints were evalu-
ated both from randomization (week 0) and from the start of the lead-in 
period (week –12) to week 72.
In addition, changes in the intensity of antihypertensive and 
lipid-lowering therapies in the double-blind period, as reported by 
the investigator, were assessed as prespecified exploratory endpoints.
Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events 
and serious adverse events that occurred during the reporting period. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events, acute pancreatitis and deaths 
were reviewed by an independent external adjudication committee.
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 600 participants provided power of >90% to demon-
strate the superiority of tirzepatide MTD to placebo, for the copri -
mary endpoints, each at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Sample 
size calculation assumed a difference of at least 12% in mean per cent 
weight reduction from randomization to week 72 for tirzepatide MTD 
as compared with placebo, a common s.d. of 10% and a dropout rate 
of 25%. Efficacy and safety endpoints were analyzed with data from all 
randomly assigned participants who took at least one dose of study 
drug (modified intention-to-treat population).
Two estimands (TRE and efficacy) were used to assess treatment 
efficacy from different perspectives and accounted for intercurrent 
events differently.
The TRE uses a treatment policy strategy to handle intercurrent 
events (ICH E9(R1)) and is intended to give an estimation of the average 
treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo for all participants 
who had undergone randomization, regardless of treatment adher -
ence. For estimation for this estimand, the intercurrent events and 
resulting missing values were handled by a hybrid approach using 
retrieved dropouts imputation from the same treatment group or 
using all nonmissing data assuming missing at random. This estimand 
is therefore also referred to as a ‘hybrid’ estimand in the study protocol. 
Continuous endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model, and categorical endpoints were analyzed by logistical regres-sion. Both models included randomized treatment and stratification 
factors (country/pooled country, sex and per cent body weight reduc -
tion at the end of lead-in (<10 and ≥10%) as fixed effects, and baseline 
measure as a covariate. Analyses were conducted with hybrid imputa -
tion of missing body weight at 72 weeks and statistical inference over hybrid imputation of missing data guided by Rubin
47.
Specifically, for missing data solely due to COVID-19, missing data 
were considered as missing at random and imputed using all available 
nonmissing data of the outcome measurement from the same treat -
ment arm; for missing data due to other intercurrent events, these 
were imputed based on retrieved dropouts in the same treatment 
arm, defined as observed primary outcome measurements, from par -
ticipants in the same treatment group, who had their efficacy assessed 
after early discontinuation of the study drug.
The efficacy estimand uses a hypothetical strategy to handle inter -
current events (ICH E9(R1)) and represented the average treatment 
effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo, before treatment discon -
tinuation, for all participants who had undergone randomization. The resulting missing values (unobserved, discarded) after treat
-
ment discontinuation were implicitly handled using a mixed model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) under the assumption of missing at 
random. Continuous endpoints were analyzed using a MMRM model, and categorical endpoints by logistical regression. MMRM analysis 
included randomized treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction 
and stratification factors (country/pooled country, sex and per cent 
body weight reduction at the end of lead-in (<10 and ≥10%) as fixed 
effects, and baseline measure as a covariate. The logistical regression 
model included randomized treatment, the same stratification factors 
as fixed effects and baseline measure as a covariate. Missing values 
were imputed by the predicted value from the MMRM model above, 
and continuous measurements were then dichotomized to binary 
outcomes. The type 1 error rate was controlled at a level of 0.05 within 
each estimand for evaluation of primary and key secondary objectives.
Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS v.9.4, unless other-
wise specified.

XPatients were screened and enrolled  irrespective of their race/ethnicity. Data are provided in Table 2 and Extended Data Table 1.
All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. To maintain masking of participants and site staff, the single-dose pens were identical between active product and placebo. The sample  size was determined  based  on achieving  approximately  600 participants  randomly  assigned  to study drug intervention  (300 participants  per treatment  group).  Sample  size determination  assumed  that evaluation  of superiority  of tirzepatide  MTD (10 mg or 15 mg) to placebo  would  be conducted  at a 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05using a 2-sample t-test. Additionally, adifference ofatleast12%mean bodyweight percentage reduction fromrandomization at72 weeks fortirzepatide MTDcompared toplacebo, a common SDof 10%, anda dropout rateof25% were assumed for statistical power calculations. Under the 
assumptions above, randomizing 600 participants ina1:1ratio to MTD (300 participants) andplacebo (300 participants) provide dmore than90%power todemonstrate superiority oftirzepatide MTDtoplacebo.The chosen sample size andrandomization ratio also provide d>90% power toestablish superiority of 
tirzepatide MTDto placebo interms of proportion of participants achieving at least 5%bodyweight reduction fromrandomization at72weeks, based on aChi-square testata2-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming 20%placebo treated participants and 46% tirzepatide treated participants achieve dthegoaland a 
dropout rateof25%.
In this study, all randomly assigned participants took at least one dose of study intervention. Therefore, the intention-to-treat population is the same as the modified intention-to-treat population. Two estimands, (treatment-regimen estimand and efficacy estimand), were used to assess 
treatment efficacy from different perspectives and accounted for intercurrent events differently. The treatment-regimen estimand represented the average treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo for all participants who had undergone randomization, regardless of treatment 
adherence.The efficacy estimand represented the average treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo, prior to treatment discontinuation, for all participants who had undergone randomization. 
Results  were consistent  between  the protocol  defined  estimands.  This study is part of a broader  phase 3 pr ogram  (SURMOUNT) . 
Participants  who achieved  ≥5.0%  weight  reduction  at the end of the 12-week  lead-in  period  were randomly  assigned  in a 1:1 ratio to receive  either the maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  of tirzepatide  (10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo.  Assignment  to treatment  group was determined  by a 
computer-generated  random  sequence  using a validated  interactive  web-response  system.  Randomization  was stratified  according  to country,  sex (female,  male),  and percent  weight  reduction  at the end of lead-in  (<10%  versus  ≥10%).

randomization to week 72.  Key secondary endpoints controlled for type 1 error rate included the proportion of study participants who achieved ≥10%, ≥15%, or ≥20% weight reductions from randomization to week 72, the proportion of participants who, at week 72, 
maintained ≥80% of the body weight loss achieved during the 12-week lead-in period, and the change in waist circumference (cm) from randomization to week 72.
