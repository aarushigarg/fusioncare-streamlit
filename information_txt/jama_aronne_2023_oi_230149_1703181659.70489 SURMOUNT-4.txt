IMPORTANCE
The effect of continued treatment with tirzepatide on maintaining initial
weight reduction is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of tirzepatide, with diet and physical activity, on the
maintenance of weight reduction.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This phase 3, randomized withdrawal clinical trial
conducted at 70 sites in 4 countries with a 36-week, open-label tirzepatide lead-in periodfollowed by a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period included adults with a bodymass index greater than or equal to 30 or greater than or equal to 27 and a weight-relatedcomplication, excluding diabetes.
INTERVENTIONS Participants (n = 783) enrolled in an open-label lead-in period received
once-weekly subcutaneous maximum tolerated dose (10 or 15 mg) of tirzepatide for 36weeks. At week 36, a total of 670 participants were randomized (1:1) to continue receivingtirzepatide (n = 335) or switch to placebo (n = 335) for 52 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the mean percent change in
weight from week 36 (randomization) to week 88. Key secondary end points included theproportion of participants at week 88 who maintained at least 80% of the weight loss duringthe lead-in period.
RESULTS Participants (n = 670; mean age, 48 years; 473 [71%] women; mean weight,
107.3 kg) who completed the 36-week lead-in period experienced a mean weight reductionof 20.9%. The mean percent weight change from week 36 to week 88 was −5.5% withtirzepatide vs 14.0% with placebo (difference, −19.4% [95% CI, −21.2% to −17.7%]; P< .001).
Overall, 300 participants (89.5%) receiving tirzepatide at 88 weeks maintained at least 80%of the weight loss during the lead-in period compared with 16.6% receiving placebo(P< .001). The overall mean weight reduction from week 0 to 88 was 25.3% for tirzepatide
and 9.9% for placebo. The most common adverse events were mostly mild to moderategastrointestinal events, which occurred more commonly with tirzepatide vs placebo.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In participants with obesity or overweight, withdrawing
tirzepatide led to substantial regain of lost weight, whereas continued treatment maintainedand augmented initial weight reduction.

Therefore, current guidelines recommend adjunctive

2-4Randomized withdrawal studies of
antiobesity medications to date have consistently demon-strated clinically significant body weight regain with cessa-tionoftherapy.
5,6Thereisalsoevidencethatantiobesitymedi-
cations,includinglong-actingglucagon-likepeptide-1(GLP-1)receptor agonists, naltrexone/bupropion, phentermine/topiramate, and orlistat, may help maintenance of achievedweightreduction.

Tirzepatide is a single molecule that combines glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1receptor agonism
13resulting in synergistic effects on appe-
tite, food intake, and metabolic function.14-16Tirzepatide
is approved in many countries, including the US, EU, andJapan, as a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable for type 2diabetes and for the treatment of obesity in the US andUK.
16-18In a placebo-controlled trial of participants with
obesity or overweight without diabetes, tirzepatide led tomean reductions in body weight up to 20.9% after 72 weeksof treatment.

Methods
Study Design
SURMOUNT-4 was a phase 3 randomized withdrawal studywith a 36-week, open-label tirzepatide lead-in period fol-lowed by a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlledperiod conducted at 70 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan,and the US. The trial started on March 29, 2021, and fin-ished on May 18, 2023. The study protocol ( Supplement 1 )
was approved by the ethical review board at each site andwas followed according to local regulations and the prin-ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki, Council of Interna-tional Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethi-cal Guidelines, and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-pants before participation in this study.
Participants
Eligible participants (18 years or older) had a body massindex (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 or greater than orequal to 27 and at least 1 weight-related complication (ie,hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, or car-diovascular disease). Key exclusion criteria included diabe-tes, prior or planned surgical treatment for obesity, and
treatment with a medication that promotes weight losswithin 3 months prior to enrollment. Full eligibility criteriaare shown in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2 . The study was
not designed to represent the racial diversity of each ofthe participating countries. Race and ethnicity were self-reported by participants in this study using fixed selectioncategories.
Procedures
Tirzepatidewasadministeredonceweeklyasasubcutaneousinjection. During the 36-week, open-label lead-in period, thestarting dose of tirzepatide was 2.5 mg and was increasedby 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until a maximum tolerated doseof 10 or 15 mg was achieved (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2 ).
Throughout the study, gastrointestinal symptoms were man-aged by dietary counseling, symptomatic medications perthe investigator’s discretion, or skipping of a single dose oftreatment as described in the protocol ( Supplement 1 ). Dur-
ing the lead-in period, if these mitigations were not success-ful, a cycle of tirzepatide dose deescalation and reescalation(in 2.5-mg increments) was allowed. At the end of the lead-inperiod, participants who attained the maximum tolerateddose of tirzepatide (10 or 15 mg) were randomized in a1:1 ratio by a computer-generated random sequence using aninteractive web-response system to either continue receivingthe maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide or switch tomatching placebo for an additional 52 weeks. Randomizationwas stratified by country, sex, maximum tolerated dose oftirzepatide, and percent weight reduction at week 36 (<10%vs ≥10%). Dose adjustments were not permitted during thedouble-blindtreatmentperiod.
All participants received lifestyle counseling by a quali-
fied health care professional throughout the study toencourage adherence to a healthy 500 kcal/d deficit dietand at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. TheuseofconcomitantmedicationsisdescribedineAppendix2inSupplement2 .Key Points
Question Does once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide with diet
and physical activity affect maintenance of body weight reductionin individuals with obesity or overweight?
Findings After 36 weeks of open-label maximum tolerated
dose of tirzepatide (10 or 15 mg), adults (n = 670) withobesity or overweight (without diabetes) experienceda mean weight reduction of 20.9%. From randomization(at week 36), those switched to placebo experienced a 14%weight regain and those continuing tirzepatide experiencedan additional 5.5% weight reduction during the 52-weekdouble-blind period.
Meaning In participants with obesity/overweight, withdrawing
tirzepatide led to substantial regain of lost weight, whereascontinued treatment maintained and augmented initialweight reduction.Effect of Tirzepatide on Maintenance of Weight Reduction Original Investigation Research

Outcomes
Theprimaryendpointwasthepercentchangeinbodyweight
from randomization (week 36) to week 88. Key secondaryend points capturing weight maintenance and regain,respectively, were the proportion of participants at week 88maintaining at least 80% of the body weight loss during the36-week open-label period and time during the 52-weekdouble-blind treatment period to first occurrence of partici-pants returning to greater than 95% baseline body weightfor those who lost at least 5% during the open-label lead-inperiod. Key secondary end points also included change inabsolute body weight and waist circumference during thedouble-blind period (week 36 to 88) and the proportion ofparticipants achieving weight reduction thresholds of atleast 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, and at least 20% sinceenrollment (week 0 to 88); the proportion of participantsachieving at least 25% weight reduction from week 0 to 88was a prespecified exploratory end point.
Additional secondary end points included change from
randomization (week 36) to week 88 and from enrollment(week 0) to week 88 in cardiometabolic risk factors includ-ing glycemic parameters, fasting insulin, lipids, blood pres-sure, and patient-reported outcomes measured by the ShortForm-36 Version 2 Health Survey (SF-36 v2) acute form andImpact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite-Clinical Trials Ver-sion (IWQOL-Lite-CT).
Safety assessments included treatment-emergent ad-
verse events, serious adverse events, and early discontinua-tion of study drug due to adverse events during the tirzepa-tidelead-intreatmentperiod(weeks0-36),thedouble-blindperiod(weeks36-88),andsafetyfollow-upperiod.Casesofma-jor adverse cardiovascular events, acute pancreatitis, anddeaths were reviewed by an independent external adjudica-tioncommittee.

Statistical Analysis
Unless stated otherwise, efficacy end points were analyzedusing the full analysis set (data obtained during the double-blind period, regardless of adherence to study drug) and theefficacy analysis set (data obtained during the double-blindperiod, excluding data after discontinuation of study drug).Assessment of adverse events and laboratory parametersused the safety analysis set (data obtained during thedouble-blind period and safety follow-up period, regardlessof adherence to study drug). All results from statisticalanalyses were accompanied by 2-sided 95% CIs and corre-sponding Pvalues (statistical significance was defined asP< .05). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Two estimands (treatment regimen estimand and effi-
cacy estimand) were used to assess efficacy from differentperspectivesandaccountedforintercurrenteventsandmiss-ing data.
21The treatment regimen estimand was conducted
on the full analysis set representing the mean treatmenteffect of tirzepatide relative to placebo for all participantswho had undergone randomization, regardless of treatmentadherence. If intercurrent events led to missing data, themissingness was assumed to be related to treatment, exceptfor intercurrent events solely due to COVID-19, for whichmissing at random was assumed. The efficacy estimand wasconducted on the efficacy analysis set representing the meantreatment effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo for all par-ticipants who had undergone randomization if the treatmentwas administered as intended (ie, excluding the data col-lected after study drug discontinuation). Continuous endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance modelfor the treatment regimen estimand and a mixed model forrepeated measures for the efficacy estimand, and categoricalend points were analyzed by logistic regression for both esti-mands (treatment difference was assessed by odds ratio).Details on statistical analysis methods, estimands, and han-dling of missing values are provided in eAppendix 3 inSupplement 2 and the statistical analysis plan ( Supple-
ment 3). All reported results are for the treatment regimen
estimand unless stated otherwise. The type I error rate wascontrolled within each estimand independently for evalua-tion of primary and key secondary end points with a graphi-cal approach (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2 ). Because of the
potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons, find-ings for analyses of additional secondary end points shouldbeinterpretedasexploratory.
Results
Study Participants
A total of 952 patients were screened and 783 were enrolledin the 36-week open-label tirzepatide lead-in treatmentperiod. Among enrolled participants, 113 discontinued thestudy drug during the lead-in period, most commonly dueto an adverse event or participant withdrawal ( Figure 1 ).
A total of 670 participants (92.7% achieved a maximum tol-erated dose of 15 mg and 7.3% achieved a maximum toler-ated dose of 10 mg) were randomized to continue receivingthe maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide (n = 335) orswitch to receiving placebo (n = 335). Of the randomizedparticipants, 600 (89.6%) completed the study and 575(85.8%) completed the study while receiving the studydrug. Withdrawal and “other” (mainly in the placebo groupas lack of efficacy) were the most common reasons for pre-mature study drug discontinuation during the double-blindperiod (Figure 1).
Most randomized participants were women (70.6%) and
White (80.1%), with an overall mean age of 48 years, bodyweight of 107.3 kg, BMI of 38.4, and waist circumference ofResearch Original Investigation Effect of Tirzepatide on Maintenance of Weight Reduction

emergent adverse events during the double-blind periodwereCOVID-19andgastrointestinaldisorders.Gastrointesti-nal events were more common in the tirzepatide group thanin the placebo group (diarrhea, 10.7% vs 4.8%; nausea, 8.1%vs 2.7%; and vomiting, 5.7% vs 1.2%; Table 3).

There were no adjudication-confirmed cases of pancre-
atitisreportedduringthestudy(Table3;eTable4in Supple-
ment 2). Cholelithiasis was reported in 7 participants (0.9%)during the tirzepatide lead-in treatment period (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2 ) and in 1 participant (0.3%) in both the tirz-
epatide group and placebo group during the double-blindperiod (Table 3). Acute cholecystitis was reported in 4 par-ticipants (0.5%) during the tirzepatide lead-in treatmentperiod(eTable4in Supplement2 )andin3(0.9%)inthepla-
cebo group during the double-blind period (Table 3). Nocases of medullary thyroid carcinoma or pancreatic cancerwere reported.

Discussion
The SURMOUNT-4 trial results emphasize the need to con-
tinuepharmacotherapytopreventweightregainandensurethe maintenance of weight reduction and its associated car-diometabolicbenefits.
22Atleast5trials(includingthepresent
study) across various classes of medications, including po-tentantiobesitymedicationssuchassemaglutide,havedem-onstrated that weight is substantially regained after cessa-tionofpharmacotherapy.
5,6,23,24
The consistency of these data across therapeutic classes
spanning more than 2 decades suggests that obesity isa chronic metabolic condition similar to type 2 diabetesand hypertension requiring long-term therapy in mostpatients.
A notable finding in the SURMOUNT-4 trial is that after
switching to placebo for 1 year, participants ended the studywith substantial body weight reduction (9.9%). However,
much of their initial improvement in cardiometabolicrisk factors had been reversed. Further studies are neededto understand the potential long-term benefits and risks(ie,legacyeffects)ofsuchshort-termtherapy.
The health benefits seen with continued treatment with
the maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide during thisstudy were achieved with a safety profile consistent withthat previously reported in SURMOUNT and SURPASS trialsand in studies of incretin-based therapies approved for thetreatment of obesity and overweight.
18,25-32
The strengths of this study include its large sample size
and the randomized withdrawal design. The duration ofthe open-label lead-in period allowed the study to assess themaintenance of body weight reduction. Dose escalation pro-tocols during the open-label lead-in period helped to maxi-mize tolerability and reflect dose adjustment strategies thatmaybehelpfultofutureprescribers.
Limitations
Thisstudyhaslimitations.First,thedesignofthisstudydidnot allow dose adjustments after randomization and did notevaluate the effects of intensive behavioral therapy on themaintenance of body weight reduction. Second, those whotolerated initial treatment with 10-mg or 15-mg tirzepatidemay represent a subgroup of the general population.Table 3. Adverse Events During the Double-Blind (Week 36 to 88)

Conclusions
After achieving clinically meaningful weight reduction dur-
ing a 36-week tirzepatide lead-in treatment period, adultswith obesity or overweight who continued treatment with
maximum tolerated dose tirzepatide for an additional 52weeks demonstrated superior weight maintenance and con-tinued weight reduction compared to those who switchedtoplacebo.
