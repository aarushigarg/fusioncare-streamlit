IMPORTANCE
The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide,
a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people withoverweight or obesity is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide,
2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) inadults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutidetitrated to 2.4 mg weekly.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a
withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 inadults with body mass index of at least 30 (or /H1135027 with /H113501 weight-related comorbidity) and
without diabetes.
INTERVENTIONS A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide
during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose),803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose wererandomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switchedto placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was percent change in body weight
from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waistcircumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the ShortForm 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).
RESULTS Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with
a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%]women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed thetrial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weightchange from week 20 to week 68 was −7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo(difference, −14.8 [95% CI, −16.0 to −13.5] percentage points; P< .001). Waist circumference
(−9.7 cm [95% CI, −10.9 to −8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (−3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, −5.8 to−2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6-3.3]) also improved withcontinued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P< .001). Gastrointestinal events were
reported in 4 1.9% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% withplacebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events withcontinued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed
a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintainingtreatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continuedweight loss over the following 48 weeks.

Question What effect does continued treatment with 2.4 mg of
subcutaneous semaglutide have on the maintenance of bodyweight loss in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of adults with overweight
or obesity, 803 participants completed a 20-week run-in of weeklytreatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with a meanweight loss of 10.6%, and were randomized to continuedtreatment with subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo for anadditional 48 weeks. At the end of this time, mean weight changewas −7.9% vs +6.9%, respectively, a difference that wasstatistically significant.

Changes During the Randomized Period
Primary End Point
Following randomization, the estimated mean weight
change from week 20 to week 68 was −7.9% with continuedsemaglutide vs +6.9% in participants switched to placebo(difference, −14.8 [95% CI, −16.0 to −13.5] percentagepoints; P< .001) ( Table 2; eFigure 2A, eFigure 2B [cumula-
tive distribution plot], and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1 ).
For the trial product estimand, corresponding changes were−8.8% vs +6.5%, respectively (difference, −15.3 [95% CI,−16.5 to −14.1] percentage points; P< .001) (eTable 5 and
eFigure 4 in Supplement 1 ). Results were similar when ana-
lyzed post hoc with study site as a random effect, with anestimated mean weight change from week 20 to week 68 of−7.9% with continued semaglutide vs +6.9% with placebo(difference, −14.7 [95% CI, −16.1 to −13.4] percentage points;P< .001).
Confirmatory and Supportive Secondary End Points
Waist circumference (difference, −9.7 cm [95% CI, −10.9 to
−8.5cm]; P< .001)( Figure2 A;eFigure3in Supplement1 )and

In those who continued semaglutide after randomiza-
tion, weight loss achieved during the run-in period not onlywas sustained but continued, reaching a plateau at week 60to week 68 and ultimately resulting in an estimated reduc-tionof17.4%overtheentiretrial.Incontrast,participantswhoswitchedtoplaceboatweek20graduallyregainedweight.Thebenefits of continuing semaglutide treatment for 68 weeks,rather than switching to placebo after 20 weeks, are consis-tentwithfindingsfromotherwithdrawaltrialsofantiobesitymedications.
