participants who had completed 68 weeks of treatment. This subset comprised all eli-
gible participants from any site in Canada, Germany and the UK, and sites in theUnited States and Japan with the highest main phase recruitment. All analyses in the
extension were exploratory.
Results: Extension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, mean
weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo.
Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants regained 11.6
(SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, respectively, by week 120,
resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% (SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements seen from week 0 to week 68 with
semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 120 for most variables.
Conclusions: One year after withdrawal of once-w eekly subcutaneous semaglutide
2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss,
with similar changes in cardiometabolic variabl es. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity
and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health.

1|INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a highly prevalent, complex, chronic disease1-4associated
with cardiometabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes, hyper-
tension, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease.4-6Obesity also
leads to a wide range of other health problems, is associated with sub-
stantial socioeconomic burden and was estimated to cause 5 million
deaths globally in 2019.2-4,7
Weight loss activates compensatory biological changes that pre-
vent the maintenance of long-term weight loss8,9; weight regain is
common.8,10In people with obesity, pharmacotherapy is indicated as
an adjunct to lifestyle intervention for chronic weight management andcan help with achieving and maintaining weight loss.
2,11,12Long-term
obesity pharmacotherapy may be required for weight maintenance, as
cessation of pharmacological treatment is frequently followed byweight regain, even with continued lifestyle intervention.
13-15
The present observational study examined changes in body weight
and cardiometabolic risk factors over 52 weeks following cessation ofonce-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) se maglutide 2.4 mg (or placebo) and
lifestyle intervention in participants who had completed 68 weeks of ini-
tial treatment in the randomized, plac ebo-controlled Semaglutide Treat-
ment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) 1 trial.
16Semaglutide is a
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue recently approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada and the UK Medicinesand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for chronic weight manage-ment, as an adjunct to lifestyle interv ention, at a once-weekly s.c. dose
of 2.4 mg in adults with overweight (with ≥1 weight-related condition)
or obesity.
17-19The efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight
management have been investigated in the global phase III STEP pro-
gramme.20In the main phase of the STEP 1 trial, 68 weeks of treatmentwith semaglutide plus lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight/
obesity produced clinically meaningf ul reductions in body weight, as well
as improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, and physical
functioning.16
A prior trial (STEP 4) assessed the effects of semaglutide with-
drawal, with participants initially receiving 20 weeks of semaglutide
2.4 mg treatment during a run-in period, followed by randomization
to continued semaglutide treatment or withdrawal (switch to placebo)for an additional 48 weeks, with lifestyle intervention throughout.
13
The present STEP 1 extension study complements STEP 4 by explor-ing post-treatment changes in body weight and cardiometabolic riskfactors following a longer (68-week) initial treatment period withsemaglutide or placebo, and in the absence of active lifestyle interven-
tion support during the 1-year off-treatment follow-up period.
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Trial design and participants
STEP 1 (NCT03548935) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial conducted at 129 sites across 16 countries. The design
and eligibility criteria have previously been published.16Participants
were adults (aged ≥1 8y e a r s )w i t hab o d ym a s si n d e x( B M I )o f3 0k g / m2
or higher, or of 27 kg/m2or higher with at least one weight-related
co-morbidity (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea
or cardiovascular disease), and a history of at least one self-reported
unsuccessful dietary effort to lose weight. Key exclusion criteria weretype 1 or 2 diabetes and obesity pharmacotherapy 90 days or less

treatment with once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg (n =1306) or
placebo (n =655) (2:1), plus lifestyle intervention. The lifestyle inter-
vention consisted of counselling every 4 weeks on diet (500 kcal
deficit per day relative to total estimated energy expenditure at ran-
domization) and physical activity (150 minutes per week).Semaglutide was initiated at 0.25 mg, with escalation every 4 weeks
until the 2.4 mg target dose was reached (Figure S1). At week
68 (the end of the treatment period), participants were withdrawnfrom treatment (including lifestyle intervention) and followed for
7 weeks until week 75.
The STEP 1 extension followed a subset of participants for an
additional 45 weeks (a total of 52 weeks off-treatment) until the end-of-trial visit at week 120 (Figure S1). The extension was offered in five
selected countries (Canada, Germany, Japan, the UK and theUnited States) that were representative of the global trial population
and aimed to include approximately 300 participants. In Canada,
Germany and the UK, all sites with subjects interested in participatingin the extension were included (Canada: six sites; Germany: 13 sites;
UK: 10 sites). In the United States and Japan, the sites included in the
extension (United States: five sites; Japan: three sites) were objec-tively selected based on those with the highest recruitment in the
STEP 1 main phase (using an assumed on-treatment completion rate
for the main phase [70%] and an assumed participant willingness toparticipate in the extension [80%] to determine the number of sites

required to achieve the target participant number). All participants
from the selected sites could enter the extension, provided they metthe extension phase eligibility criteria. To be eligible for the extension,
participants were required to have completed treatment with
semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo at week 68 and to provide informedconsent for the extension. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or
intention of becoming pregnant during the extension and any factor
that could have jeopardized compliance (as judged by theinvestigator).
The STEP 1 trial (including the extension) complied with the Inter-
national Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guide-
line and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and amendmentswere approved by the relevant institutional review board or indepen-
dent ethics committee at each trial site.
2.2 |Procedures
The first two visits of the off-treatment observational extension phase
coincided with the week 68 and week 75 visits in the main phase,
with three further visits conducted at weeks 80, 104 and120 (Figure S1). Body measurements, vital sign recording and labora-tory assessments (HbA1c, lipid levels and C-reactive protein [CRP])
were undertaken at each visit. No systematic collection of adverse
events was performed in the extension. Investigators and participantsremained blinded to the original treatment allocation until extension
completion.No treatments were actively administered or prohibited during
the extension. Concomitant treatments or events that might impactweight (obesity pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery; medications for
hypertension, diabetes or reducing lipids; pregnancy) were recorded
during the extension phase. Participation in lifestyle interventions thatmight impact weight were not recorded.
Participants unable to attend site visits because of the COVID-
19 pandemic were offered telephone visits as an alternative. Ana-lyses were limited to data recorded during onsite visits; dataobtained from telephone visits were self-reported and therefore
not evaluated.
2.3 |Outcomes
The extension addressed two exploratory objectives: (1) to examine
the change in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in partici-
pants who completed treatment in the main phase and were followedduring the off-treatment period; and (2) to evaluate the consistency
of the 68-week treatment effect of semaglutide (relative to placebo)
in participants in the main phase and extension phase.
Endpoints included changes (from week 68 to week 120 for the
first objective; from week 0 to week 68 for the second objective) in
body weight (% and kg), BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure
(SBP and DBP), CRP, HbA1c and lipids, including triglycerides, totalcholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)TABLE 1 (Continued)

was defined by HbA1c 5.7%-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol). In the FAS, the presence of prediabetes was determined by investigators on the basis of availableinformation (e.g. medical records, concomitant medication and blood glucose variables) and in accordance with American Diabetes Association HbA1 c
criteria.

cholesterol and free fatty acids (the latter for the second explor-
atory objective only, because of different fasting conditions in themain and extension phases). HbA1c was also used to determine
glycaemic category (normoglycaemia, prediabetes or diabetes, as
per American Diabetes Association HbA1c criteria
21) and changes
in the proportion of participants in each category were assessed.Post hoc analyses explored changes in body weight from baseline
to week 120 and in a variety of participant subgroups (from base-
line to week 68 and week 120, and from week 68 to week 120),and the proportion of participants with 5% or higher weight loss
from baseline at week 120.2.4 |Statistical analysis
No power calculations were performed to determine the sample size.
All extension phase analyses were exploratory and performed in the
extension analysis set (ExAS), which included all participants eligiblefor the extension who attended at least one visit on week 75, 80,104 or 120.
Endpoints addressing the first exploratory objective were
analysed descriptively using observed data from the in-trial period(the time from randomization to last contact with a trial site) for the
ExAS. No estimands were specified.

Endpoints addressing the second exploratory objective were
analysed descriptively and statistically using data from the in-trialperiod for the ExAS. Results for the ExAS were compared with results
previously reported for the full analysis set (FAS),
16which included all
participants randomized in the main phase according to the intention-to-treat principle. For the statistical analyses reported herein, the treat-
ment policy estimand was used to quantify the 68-week treatment
effect of semaglutide (relative to placebo) in all participants,irrespective of treatment adherence or initiation of other obesity thera-
pies. Week 68 responses were examined using an analysis of covari-
ance model with randomized treatment as factor and baseline endpointvalue as covariate. Missing observations were multiply (x 1000)imputed from participants within the same randomized treatment arm
with available measurements at week 68. Results from statistical ana-
lyses were accompanied by two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Percentage changes in body weight and selected cardiometabolic
risk factors were calculated relative t o the baseline value of the variable.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Study participants
From September 2019 to April 2020, 336 participants from the main
phase were screened for the extension and 333 entered theextension, including 232 participants who received semaglutide during
the main phase (referred to as the “semaglutide arm ”hereafter) and
101 who received placebo during the main phase ( “placebo arm ”
hereafter). In total, 327 participants (98.2%) were included in the ExAS
(Figure S2). The majority of participants completed the extension(93.7%; n =312/333). Data from the final week 120 visit were avail-
able from site visits for 290 participants (semaglutide arm: n =197;
placebo arm: n =93). An additional 22 participants completed the
end-of-trial visit via telephone or email contact.
When assessed according to anatomical therapeutic chemical
classification system codes, obesity pharmacotherapies were initiatedor ongoing in the extension in two (0.9%) and three (3.0%) participantsin the semaglutide and placebo arms, respectively. As medications
may have been used off-label for weight management, obesity phar-
macotherapy use was also assessed using investigator-reported medi-cation classification. Using this definition, there were 21 (9.2%)
obesity pharmacotherapy users in the semaglutide arm and six (6.1%)
in the placebo arm during the extension, including GLP-1 receptoragonist use in 14 (6.1%) and four (4.0%) participants in the
semaglutide and placebo arms, respectively (including semaglutide up
to 1.0 mg and liraglutide up to 3.0 mg). Mean duration of investigator-reported obesity pharmacotherapy usage in the extension phase was
172.1 and 264.7 days in the semaglutide and placebo arms, respec-
tively (range: 8-364 days). No participants became pregnant or hadbariatric surgery during the extension.

Demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline were gen-
erally well balanced across the two arms in the ExAS (Table 1).
Most participants were female (67.0%) and White (75.8%), with amean age of 49.0 years, weight of 105.5 kg and BMI of
37.6 kg/m
2. Prediabetes was present in 59.6% of participants. The
ExAS and FAS had similar demographics and clinical characteristicsat baseline.
3.2 |Change in body weight and BMI
During the main treatment phase (from baseline [week 0] to week 68),
semaglutide reduced body weight more than placebo (Figure 1Aand
Tables 2and S1); observed mean weight loss was 17.3% (standard
deviation [SD]: 9.3%) with semaglutide versus 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) withplacebo (Table S1). After treatment withdrawal, body weight regain
was observed in both the semaglutide and placebo arms (Figure 1A
and Tables 2and S1). Participants regained a mean of 11.6 percentage
points (SD: 7.7) of body weight in the semaglutide arm versus 1.9 per-
centage points (SD: 4.8) in the placebo arm (Table S1). The net mean
body weight loss over the full duration of the main treatment phaseand off-treatment extension phase (from week 0 to week 120) was
5.6% (SD: 8.9%) in the semaglutide arm versus 0.1% (SD: 5.8%) in the
placebo arm (Figure
1A). At week 120, 5% or higher weight loss from
baseline was observed in 48.2% of participants (95 of 197) in thesemaglutide arm and in 22.6% (21 of 93) in the placebo arm.
With regard to consistency of the treatment effect between ExAS
and FAS, in the ExAS the estimated mean change from week 0 to week68 was –17.3% with semaglutide versus –2.0% with placebo (esti-
mated treatment difference [ETD]: –15.3%; 95% CI: –17.3%, –13.3%).

Respective values for the FAS were –14.9% versus –2.4% (ETD:
–12.4%; 95% CI: –13.4%, –11.5%).
Changes in BMI during the main treatment phase and extension
phase were consistent with changes in body weight and are reportedin Tables
2, S1 and S2.
3.3 |Change in body weight in participant
subgroups
Changes from baseline in body weight at week 120 differed according
to the weight lost by week 68. Subgroups with greater weight losses
from week 0 to week 68 tended to have numerically greater weight
regains from week 68 to week 120, but maintained numericallygreater net weight losses from week 0 to week 120 (Figure
1Band
Table S3). Participants in the semaglutide arm with weight losses
(i.e. < 5%, ≥5%-< 10%, ≥10%-< 15%, ≥15%-< 20% and ≥20%) from
week 0 to week 68 had net weight changes from week 0 to week120 of 4.2% (SD: 6.2%), –0.7% (SD: 5.9%), –1.8% (SD: 5.0%), –5.5%
(SD: 7.2%) and –12.1% (SD: 8.9%), respectively. In absolute terms,
respective changes from week 0 to week 120 for these subgroupswere 4.8 (SD: 7.3), –0.9 (SD: 6.7), –2.1 (SD: 5.3), –6.4 (SD: 9.6) and
–12.2 (SD: 9.5) kg.Changes in body weight differed according to participants' base-
line characteristics (Table S4). In the semaglutide arm, mean changes
from week 0 to week 120 were numerically greater for women versus
men; higher versus lower baseline BMI categories; and participantswith normoglycaemia versus prediabetes at baseline. Mean changes inbody weight from week 0 to week 120 in the semaglutide arm were
similar across subgroups defined by baseline age tertiles (Table S4).
Changes in body weight from week 0 to week 68 and from week68 to week 120 for these subgroups are reported in Table S4.
When obesity pharmacotherapy users were excluded, changes in
body weight (Figure
1C) were similar to the full ExAS (Figure 1A).
Among the subgroup not using obesity pharmacotherapy, mean
changes in body weight from week 0 to week 120 were –5.6% (SD:
8.9%) and –0.3% (SD: 5.3%) in the semaglutide and placebo arms,
respectively.
3.4 |Change in cardiometabolic risk factors
During treatment, greater improvements in cardiovascular risk factors
were observed from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide than pla-cebo (Tables
2and S1), which tended to be slightly larger in the ExAS
than in the FAS (Table S2). After treatment withdrawal, mean SBP and

DBP increased in both treatment arms, reverting to baseline levels by
week 120 (Figure 2and Tables 2and S1). CRP and lipids increased
from week 68 to week 120 in the semaglutide arm, but remained
improved relative to the placebo arm for CRP, HDL cholesterol, VLDL
cholesterol and triglycerides at week 120 (Figures 2and S3 and
Tables 2and S1). Improvements were observed in some cardiovascu-
lar risk factors from baseline to week 120 (Figures 2and S3 and
Table 2), including for LDL cholesterol and CRP in both semaglutide
and placebo arms and for HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and tri-
glycerides in the semaglutide arm.
During treatment, a greater decrease in HbA1c was observed
from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide than placebo (Tables 2and
S1), which was slightly larger in the ExAS than in the FAS (Table S2).
After treatment withdrawal, increases in mean HbA1c were observed
in both treatment arms. Although the magnitude of increase fromweek 68 to week 120 was greater in the semaglutide arm than in the
placebo arm (Table S1), the semaglutide arm maintained a small rela-
tive improvement versus the placebo arm in HbA1c at week 120 (Fig-ure
2). Compared with baseline, at week 120, observed mean HbA1c
was reduced in the semaglutide arm and similar in the placebo arm
(Figure 2, Table 2).
In the semaglutide group, greater magnitudes of weight loss from
week 0 to week 68 tended to be associated with the most favourable
changes in cardiometabolic risk factors from baseline at week120 (Tables S5 and S6).
3.5 |Change in glycaemic category
Among participants with prediabetes at baseline, numerically more
participants reverted to normoglycaemia at week 68 with semaglutidethan placebo (93.6% vs. 41.5%; Figure
3). After treatment withdrawal,
improvements deteriorated in both arms. Although the deterioration
was larger in the semaglutide arm, a relative improvement wasmaintained versus the placebo arm at week 120, with reversion tonormoglycaemia in 43.3% versus 34.0% of participants with baseline
prediabetes in the semaglutide and placebo arms, respectively.
Changes in body weight in the subgroup of participants who shiftedfrom prediabetes at baseline to normoglycaemia at week 68 and then
reverted to prediabetes by week 120 are shown in Figure
1Dand
Table S4.
Few participants with normoglycaemia at baseline had progres-
sion to prediabetes at week 68 or week 120, in either of the
semaglutide or placebo arms (Figure 3).
4|DISCUSSION
In STEP 1, 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly s.c. semaglutide
2.4 mg plus lifestyle intervention provided significant, clinically rele-
vant reductions in body weight versus placebo among adults withoverweight/obesity.
16After withdrawal of semaglutide and structured
lifestyle intervention, participants regained a mean of two-thirds oftheir prior weight loss in the 1-year off-treatment extension phase;
weight regain continued until the end of follow-up (week 120). How-ever, some treatment effects were sustained and weight remained
5.6% below baseline in the semaglutide arm. Almost half of the partic-
ipants in the semaglutide arm (48.2%) still had clinically meaningfulweight loss of 5% or more from baseline at week 120, although this
proportion represented a substantial fall from that originally achieved
at the end of 68 weeks of treatment (86.4%).
16Subgroup analyses
suggested that participants in the semaglutide arm with greater
weight loss during the 68-week treatment period tended to have
greater regain in body weight after semaglutide withdrawal, but ulti-mately retained greater weight loss at week 120 versus subgroupswho lost less weight during the 68-week treatment period.
Weight regain has previously been observed following withdrawal
of obesity pharmacotherapies, including orlistat and lorcaserin —and
also semaglutide, as shown in STEP 4 —despite continued lifestyle
intervention.
13-15Taken together, these findings and those of the pre-
sent study confirm the chronicity of obesity and highlight the impor-tance of maintaining long-term pharmacological treatment for weight
management in people with obesity.
In the STEP 1 extension, weight regain was comparatively rapid
following semaglutide withdrawal compared with that seen in other
obesity pharmacotherapy withdrawal trials, including after
semaglutide withdrawal in STEP 4.
13-15This may well relate to partici-
pants who received semaglutide in STEP 1 having achieved greaterweight loss prior to withdrawal than in other trials, and thus having
greater potential for regain, driven by physiological and behavioural
factors.
22,23Accordingly, the steepest trajectory of weight regain after
withdrawal was observed in participants who had lost 20% or more of
baseline body weight during treatment. Furthermore, the absence of
structured lifestyle intervention following semaglutide withdrawalcontrasts with the continuation of lifestyle intervention in other with-
drawal trials (including in STEP 4)
13-15and may also have contributed
to the trajectory of weight regain.
Mean body weight data suggested a slowing of weight regain
towards the end of the extension phase in participants withdrawn
from semaglutide. By contrast, the STEP 4 study did not show a clear
slowing of weight regain towards the end of its 48-week observationperiod following semaglutide withdrawal.
14However, interpretation
of weight trajectory in STEP 4 is limited by the comparatively small
magnitude of weight regain (owing to the shorter treatment durationand smaller initial weight loss in STEP 4 relative to STEP 1, and the
continuation of lifestyle intervention).
14Whether the slowing in
regain in the off-treatment STEP 1 extension represents a plateauingof mean body weight below baseline levels, or simply a slowing of
weight regain as body weight approached baseline, cannot be deter-
mined without longer follow-up.
Subgroup analyses indicated no difference in weight loss based
on age, but did suggest lesser mean weight loss in men relative to
women in the semaglutide arm, both at the end of active treatment
(at week 68) and at the end of the off-treatment extension phase(at week 120). Despite the small difference between men and women,
weight losses during treatment were still substantial and clinicallyWILDING ET AL. 1561

meaningful in both sexes. Subgroup analyses based on baseline BMI cat-
egories showed inconsistent trends in the semaglutide arm: weight lossduring treatment (week 0 to week 68) showed no clear trend across
increasing BMI categories, but over week 0 to week 120 showed a trend
for greater weight loss in the subgroups of patients with higher versuslower baseline BMI categories, in part owing to a lesser weight regain in
the 40 kg/m
2or higher subgroup than most others. However, the differ-
ences in weight loss between baseline BMI subgroups were compara-tively small, and a meaningful effect of baseline BMI cannot be
concluded based on the present data . Differences in weight loss in the
semaglutide arm were also seen based on baseline glycaemic status, withlesser weight loss from baseline at week 68 and week 120 among thosewith prediabetes at baseline relative to those with normoglycaemia. This
finding is consistent with the established difficulty of achieving weight
loss among people with type 2 diabetes, and with the previous observa-tion of smaller reductions in body weight with semaglutide 2.4 mg in
patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes in the STEP
2 trial,
24relative to those seen during the main treatment period of STEP
1, which excluded patients with type 2 diabetes.16
We observed residual benefits in some cardiovascular risk factors
at week 120 compared with baseline. Previously, a post hoc analysisof the Look AHEAD trial explored the effects of weight regain on car-
diometabolic risk factors among people with overweight/obesity and
type 2 diabetes who received intensive lifestyle intervention.
25In that
analysis, large initial weight losses followed by partial or full regain byyear 4 were associated with a sustained benefit on HbA1c at year
4 relative to that seen in participants with smaller or no initial weight
loss.
25In the STEP 1 extension, the semaglutide arm maintained a
small improvement from baseline in HbA1c, and also in other car-
diometabolic risk factors (LDL, VLDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycer-
ides and CRP) after 1 year off-treatment, despite partial weightregain. Although many participants who reverted from prediabetes to
normoglycaemia during semaglutide treatment subsequently returned
to prediabetes after withdrawal, the semaglutide arm maintained a rel-ative improvement at week 120 compared with the placebo arm.Reversion from normoglycaemia to prediabetes after semaglutide
withdrawal may relate to loss of the direct effects of GLP-1 receptor
agonism on glycaemic levels. However, the present study does notallow definitive conclusions regarding mechanisms driving changes in
glycaemic status. Overall, although a net beneficial effect on several
cardiometabolic variables was maintained 1 year after semaglutidewithdrawal, greater benefits were seen during the treatment period,
supporting the need for continued treatment. The benefits remaining
at 1 year post-withdrawal appear to be related to the magnitude ofinitial weight loss at week 68. A longer follow-up study is needed to
determine if these remaining benefits would ultimately be lost or
retained.
The strengths of the STEP 1 extension include the pragmatic trial
design, with no active intervention and infrequent site contact. This
more closely mimics a real-world setting and may aid understanding
of real-world effects of semaglutide withdrawal. Additional strengthsinclude the multinational setting and the high rates of trial completion.
The key limitations of the extension were the relatively small samplesize compared with the main STEP 1 trial population and the selection
of sites based on those with the highest recruitment in the STEP1 main phase, which could introduce an element of selection bias.
However, participants were from a range of countries representative
of those included in the main phase, and comparison of baseline char-acteristics among the ExAS and FAS indicated that the extension sam-
ple was representative. Weight losses with semaglutide versus
placebo from week 0 to week 68 were slightly greater in the ExASthan in the FAS, as expected given that the ExAS only included partici-
pants who completed 68 weeks of treatment. Another limitation was
the potential for obesity pharmacotherapy use during the extension.However, few participants used obesity pharmacotherapy so our find-ings were not confounded, as shown by the consistency of body
weight changes in the overall ExAS and the subgroup of participants
not using obesity pharmacotherapy. In addition, all analyses wereexploratory and thus no formal tests of statistical significance were
performed.
In conclusion, among adults with overweight/obesity, after a sub-
stantial reduction in body weight during 68 weeks of treatment with
once-weekly s.c. semaglutide plus lifestyle intervention, subsequent
treatment withdrawal led to most of the weight loss being regainedwithin 1 year, and a similar change in some cardiometabolic variables
back to baseline, reinforcing the need for continued treatment to
maintain weight loss and cardiometabolic benefits.
