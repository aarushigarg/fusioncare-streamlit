Aim: We assessed the impact of tirzepatide on 10-year predicted risk of developing
type 2 diabetes (T2D) among participants in the SURMOUNT-1 trial.
Materials and Methods: In this post hoc analysis of SURMOUNT-1, the Cardiometa-
bolic Disease Staging risk engine was used to calculate the 10-year predicted risk of T2D
at baseline, week 24 and week 72 among participants randomized to receive 5, 10, or
15 mg tirzepatide or placebo. Mean changes in risk scores from baseline to weeks
24 and 72 were compared between tirzepat ide and placebo groups. Subgroup analyses
were conducted based on participants' glycaemi c status and body mass index at baseline.
Results: Mean baseline T2D predicted risk scores did not differ between tirzepatide
and placebo groups (range: 22.9%-24.3%). At week 72, mean absolute T2D predicted
risk score reductions were significantly greater in tirzepatide groups (5 mg, 12.4%;
10 mg, 14.4%; 15 mg, 14.7%) versus placebo (0.7%). At week 72, median relative pre-
dicted risk reductions following tirzepatide treatment ranged from 60.3% to 69.0%.
For participants with and without prediabetes, risk reductions were significantly
greater in tirzepatide groups versus placebo. At week 72, participants with prediabe-tes (range: 16.0%-20.3%) had greater mean risk score reductions from baseline ver-
sus those without prediabetes (range: 10.1%-11.3%). Across body mass index
subgroups, mean reductions from baseline were significantly greater in tirzepatide
groups versus placebo.
Conclusion: Tirzepatide treatment significantly reduced the 10-year predicted risk of
developing T2D compared with placebo in participants with obesity or overweight,
regardless of baseline glycaemic status.

1|INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease, and its prevalence in
the United States and globally is increasing rapidly.1–4Obesity is
strongly linked to increased risk o f type 2 diabetes (T2D) and other
serious diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and
dyslipidaemia.5People with obesity are nearly three times more
likely to develop T2D than those without obesity.6Moreover, the
risk of developing T2D is higher in the presence of prediabetes.7
There is a positive correlation among higher body mass index (BMI),larger waist circumference and the risk of developing T2D.
8Weight
reduction in obesity improves existing obesity-related complicationsand reduces their risk in the future.
9–11Lifestyle modification
(including nutrition and physical activity) is the foundation of obesity
treatment, and additional therapies (e.g. pharmacotherapy or bariat-ric surgery) can be considered based on individual characteristics
and health goals or when lifestyle-based interventions have been
unsuccessful.
9,12–14
The goal of obesity management is to improve the health of
patients with this disease.9Even a 5%-10% body weight reduction
from baseline is considered clinically meaningful, resulting in improvedmetabolic markers, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and pancreatic
beta-cell function.
11,15,16Furthermore, among adults without T2D,
studies showed that lifestyle intervention leading to more than 7%weight reduction corresponded to nearly 60% reduced incidence ofT2D and with every kilogram of weight lost, there was a 16% reduc-
tion in risk of developing diabetes.
17,18
Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists
such as liraglutide (3 mg) or semaglutide (2.4 mg) induced significant
weight reduction and improvement i n glycaemic control in adults with
or without diabetes.19–23GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment also
resulted in reduced waist circumfe rence along with improvements in
systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyc erides and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol.19,20Tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for T2D and indevelopment for obesity, promot ed weight reduction among people
with or without T2D.
24–27Specifically, in the Phase 3 randomized clini-
cal trial SURMOUNT-1, 72 weeks of tirzepatide treatment resulted in amean weight reduction of up to 22.5% among people with obesity or
overweight without T2D (efficacy estimand).
27In a network meta-
analysis, tirzepatide resulted in significantly greater weight reductioncompared with semaglutide and liraglutide among people with obesity
without T2D.
28
The effect of tirzepatide on the long-term risk of developing T2D
in people with obesity or overweight is currently unknown. Cardiome-
tabolic Disease Staging (CMDS) provides a robust validated 10-year
risk estimate of future diabetes,29and provides an opportunity to
assess the impact of tirzepatide. The goal of this study was to assessthe impact of tirzepatide treatment on the 10-year predicted risk of
developing T2D using CMDS among participants in the
SURMOUNT-1 trial with obesity or overweight.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Study design and population
This was a post hoc analysis of individual patient level data from the
SURMOUNT-1 trial (NCT04184622), a Phase 3, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study in participants ≥18 years with obesity
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2and at least one
weight-related complication) and without T2D.27Trial participants
were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 5, 10 or 15 mg of tirzepatide, or
placebo once-weekly for 72 weeks as an adjunct to lifestyle interven-tion. This study used data from the SURMOUNT-1 efficacy analysisset, which included data from all randomized participants who had
received at least one dose of the study intervention during the treat-
ment period, excluding data after study drug discontinuation.
The original SURMOUNT-1 participant consent covered the ana-
lyses in this study. The SURMOUNT-1 protocol was approved by
institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. Thisstudy was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of
Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and its
guidelines.
2.2 |Variables and outcomes
Participants' demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were
summarized descriptively by treatment group,27and included age, sex,
race, ethnicity, BMI, waist circumference, SBP and diastolic bloodpressure (DBP), among others. The outcomes were (a) assessment of
10-year T2D predicted risk scores at baseline, week 24 and week
72, and (b) mean change of risk score from baseline to weeks24 and 72.
The CMDS risk engine was used to calculate predicted risk for
T2D at baseline and weeks 24 and 72. CMDS was designed as a toolfor assessment of T2D risk as a guide to clinicians regarding interven-tions for T2D prevention and uses quantitative data readily available
to clinicians that would probably be available in the electronic medical
record. One iteration of CMDS employs metabolic syndrome traitthresholds to assign patients to five risk strata for point-of-care use
by clinicians.
30The current analysis uses a Bayesian logistic regression
equation based on the continuous severity of metabolic syndrometraits and provides a quantitative measure of 10-year T2D risk.
29The
quantitative CMDS equation was developed using a large nationally
sampled cohort of White or Black/African American individuals, theREasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS)
study,
31and was validated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) cohort data.32CMDS was shown to be more robust compared
with other risk tools (e.g. the Framingham diabetes risk estimate)when applied to these same study populations.

The following were used as model inputs in the current analysis:
age, sex, race, waist circumference, fasting glucose, SBP, DBP,HANKOSKY ET AL. 3749

triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.29The T2D pre-
dicted risk scores were calculated at baseline, week 24 and week
72 as all the necessary model inputs were collected at these timepoints. Missing predictors were not imputed and risk scores for partic-
ipants with missing predictors were missing from analyses.
2.3 |Statistical analysis
For the primary analysis, a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM)
was performed on the change from baseline T2D predicted risk scores,
with model terms of treatment group, time point, treatment by timepoint interaction, country and baseline T2D predicted risk score. The
least squares (LS) mean, mean change from baseline and differences in
the mean change of risk scores between treatment groups wereassessed. Subgroup analyses were conducted by baseline glycaemic sta-
tus (participants with and without prediabetes) as defined by the Ameri-
can Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (fastingglucose, 100-125 mg/dl; 2 h glucose during oral glucose tolerance test,140-199 mg/dl; glycated haemoglobin, 5.7%-6.4%; at least two abnor-
mal tests were required to diagnose prediabetes)
27,33and baseline BMI
subgroups (<35; ≥35 to <40 and ≥40 kg/m2). Interactions between
treatment group and subgroups were assessed in an MMRM model sim-
ilar to the primary analysis but with additional model terms of subgroup,TABLE 1 Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of SURMOUNT-1 participants

treatment by subgroup, subgroup by time point, and treatment group by
subgroup by time interactions. In addition, the following sensitivity ana-
lyses were performed to assess the robustness of the study methodol-ogy: (a) the T2D predicted risk scores were determined using BMI
instead of waist circumference as a model input, and (b) the analyses
were performed among White or Black/African American participants≥45 years to reflect the population in which the CMDS risk engine was
developed and validated. The subgroup and sensitivity analyses used
similar MMRM models as the primary analysis.
Categorical variables (e.g. sex, race and ethnicity) were presented
using frequencies and percentages; continuous variables (e.g. age, BMI
and waist circumference) were described using means and SD. The p-
values for differences in baseline characteristics between participantswith and without prediabetes were computed using chi-squared test
for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous vari-
ables. The two-sided significance level was set at .05. All analyses wereconducted using SAS software version 9.4 (2016; SAS Institute Inc.).3|RESULTS

Overall, the model inputs for the predictive risk factors used in
the CMDS risk engine were comparable at baseline across treatment
groups (Table 3).
3.2 |Mean 10-year predicted risk of type
2 diabetes
In total, 2339 participants with at least one post-baseline measurable
T2D risk score at week 24 or week 72 were included in the primaryanalysis (5 mg, n =593; 10 mg, n =584; 15 mg; n =584; placebo,
n=578). The mean 10-year T2D predicted risk scores at baseline did
not differ between the placebo and tirzepatide treatment groups andranged from 22.9% to 24.3% (Figure
1A). At week 24, the LS mean risk
scores were: 5 mg, 12.5%; 10 mg, 11.3%; 15 mg; 11.0%; placebo, 21.4%(Figure 1A). The changes in the LS mean T2D predicted risk scores from
baseline to week 24 were significantly greater in the tirzepatide treat-
ment groups (5 mg, /C011.2%; 10 mg, /C012.4%; 15 mg, /C012.7%) com-
pared with placebo ( /C02.3%; Figure 1B). The median relative risk
reductions ranged from 48.8% to 57.2% for the tirzepatide treatment
groups versus 15.2% for the placebo group (Figure 1B). The difference
in risk reduction between tirzepatide groups (5, 10 and 15 mg) and pla-
cebo was /C08.9%,/C010.1% and /C010.4%, respectively ( p< .001 for all).
At week 72, the LS mean risk scores were: 5 mg, 11.4%; 10 mg,
9.4%; 15 mg; 9.0%; placebo, 23.0% (Figure 1A). The changes in LS mean
T2D predicted risk scores from baseline to week 72 were significantly
greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups (5 mg, /C012.4%; 10 mg,
/C014.4%; 15 mg, /C014.7%) compared with the placebo group ( /C00.7%;
Figure 1B). The median relative risk reductions at week 72 ranged from
60.3% to 69.0% for the tirzepatide treatment groups versus 10.8% forTABLE 3 Descriptive statistics of cardiometabolic disease staging risk engine model inputs

The mean baseline 10-year T2D predicted risk scores of participants
with or without prediabetes did not differ between the tirzepatideand placebo treatment groups, and the T2D predicted risk was higher
for participants with prediabetes (range: 29.1%-31.9%) than for partic-ipants without prediabetes (range: 19.0%-19.9%; Figure
1C). Reduc-
tions in the LS mean T2D predicted risk scores from baseline were
significantly greater in tirzepatide-treated participants with prediabe-tes (week 24, ranging from 15.5% to 17.7%; week 72, ranging from
16.0% to 20.3%) compared with those without prediabetes (week
24, ranging from 8.5% to 9.7%; week 72, ranging from 10.1% to11.3%; Figure

pants with and without prediabetes were significantly greater for the
tirzepatide treatment groups than for the placebo group ( p< .001 for
all). The LS mean difference in risk reduction between tirzepatide-treated participants and placebo participants was greater for those
with prediabetes (week 24: ranging from /C012.3% to /C014.4%; week

between treatment and baseline glycaemic status at both weeks
24 and 72 (interaction p< .001).
The subgroup analysis of the 10-year T2D predicted risk scores
by baseline BMI was consistent with the primary analysis. Participants
with higher BMI ( ≥40 kg/m2) had higher mean T2D predicted risk
scores at baseline relative to the lower BMI subgroups (Figure S2A).
The mean reductions from baseline in the T2D predicted risk scores
at week 72 were significantly greater in the tirzepatide treatmentgroups compared with placebo across all BMI subgroups ( p< .001 for
all; Figure
S2A,B ). There was an interaction between treatment and
higher baseline BMI subgroup at week 72 ( p< .001) but not at week
24 (p=.152).
4|DISCUSSION
This post hoc analysis of the SURMOUNT-1 trial showed that treat-
ment with tirzepatide significantly reduced the 10-year predicted riskof developing T2D compared with placebo regardless of the partici-
pants' glycaemic status at baseline. Tirzepatide reduced the predicted
relative risk of T2D by about half at week 24 and by about two-thirdsat week 72. Notably, most of the reduction in predicted risk of T2D
following tirzepatide treatment was achieved by week 24. The inter-
action between the treatment and higher baseline BMI at week72 suggests that tirzepatide may lead to greater T2D risk reductioncompared with placebo in patients with higher BMI.
Various factors such as waist circumference, SBP, DBP, lipid
levels and glycaemic status are associated with the elevated risk ofT2D in people with obesity or overweight.
7,8In the SURMOUNT-1
population, tirzepatide treatment led to improvements in SBP, DBP
and lipid levels, and significantly more participants with prediabetes inthe tirzepatide treatment groups had achieved normal glycaemic
levels compared with placebo.
27In this study, 72 weeks of tirzepatide
treatment resulted in a relative risk reduction of up to 69%, whereas arecent study, which used the same CMDS risk engine, reported that68 weeks of semaglutide (2.4 mg) treatment reduced the 10-year pre-
dicted risk of T2D by 61%.
34A potential explanation for this differ-
ence may be the greater weight reduction following tirzepatidetreatment compared with semaglutide treatment.
35–37It has been
shown that the greater weight reduction is associated with a greater
reduction in T2D risk.17
Regarding other risk factors for T2D, CMDS does not employ
polygenic risk scores as these data are not readily available to clini-
cians and does not incorporate qualitative information requiring self-report such as family history of T2D and cigarette smoking. Suffice it
to say that CMDS was designed to use quantitative data readily avail-
able to clinicians and is highly predictive of future T2D irrespective ofthe inclusion of other risk factors.
In this study, T2D risk reductions were greater in participants
with prediabetes compared with those without prediabetes. Our find-
ings align with previous reports of lower diabetes risk followingweight reduction with lifestyle-based or pharmacological interven-
tions among people with prediabetes.
18,35 –38A meta-analysis by Hawand colleagues showed that weight reduction interventions reduced
the risk of diabetes in individuals at high risk by up to 39%.39Further-
more, Penn et al. found that interventions promoting weight reduction
lowered the cumulative T2D incidence among people with impaired
glucose tolerance by 57%, with 65% lower T2D incidence in thosewho achieved at least 5% weight reduction.
40In addition, the time to
diabetes onset was significantly longer following treatment with lira-
glutide (3 mg) among adults with obesity or overweight with prediabe-tes compared with placebo.
41Sustained weight management through
pharmacological interventions, therefore, may reduce the long-term
risk of T2D and the resulting burden of disease on people with obesityor overweight.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide indirect evi-
dence of reduction in the long-term predicted risk of T2D among peo-
ple with obesity or overweight following tirzepatide treatment, withbenefits seen as early as 6 months and persisting at 18 months.
Results from the ongoing SURMOUNT-1 trial extension and the
SURMOUNT-MMO trial, a Phase 3, randomized controlled trial asses-sing the effect of tirzepatide on the reduction of morbidity and mor-
tality in adults with obesity (NCT05556512), will provide direct
evidence of the impact of tirzepatide treatment on progression fromprediabetes to T2D. If these data confirm our findings, the benefits of
treatment with tirzepatide might extend beyond glycaemic control
and weight management, leading to reduction in diabetes-relatedcomplications and mortality.
This study has several strengths. A validated model that incorpo-
rates multiple risk factors to quantitatively assess risk was used,
thereby providing credible predictions of T2D risk. The CMDS riskengine was preferred to the Framingham model as it was developed
and validated in a more generalizable population. The large size of the
global SURMOUNT-1 sample further strengthens the generalizabilityof the study results. The results of the subgroup and sensitivity ana-
lyses were consistent with the primary analyses, thereby verifying the
robustness of the findings.
The study also has certain limitations. First, as the CMDS risk
engine calculates only the T2D predicted risk scores, the results of
this modelling study should not be considered as confirmatory against
hard outcomes. Second, the CMDS risk engine was developed andvalidated in populations that were different from the SURMOUNT-1
trial population. However, we accounted for this limitation by con-
ducting a sensitivity analysis in White or Black/African Americanpatients ≥45 years, which confirmed the findings of the primary analy-
sis. Finally, the majority of the SURMOUNT-1 population was female,
White and had a BMI ≥30 kg/m
2, and the results may not be reflec-
tive of the general population with obesity or overweight. Further
research using randomized controlled trials in broader populations
may help substantiate the results of this study.
5|CONCLUSION
In summary, 24 weeks of tirzepatide treatment reduced the 10-year
predicted risk of developing T2D in participants with obesity or3754 HANKOSKY ET AL.

overweight, an effect that was sustained up to 72 weeks, regardless
of glycaemic status. The significantly greater risk reduction in partici-pants with prediabetes compared with those without was notewor-
thy. However, further research in a broader population is needed to
substantiate the clinical significance of the study findings.
