The combination of glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) with other gut hormones including the glucose-depen -
dent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has been explored to complement and enhance further the GLP-1 effects 
on glycemia and weight loss. Tirzepatide is the first dual GLP-1/GIP receptor co-agonist which has been ap -
proved for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on the findings from the SURPASS program. The 
SURPASS trials assessed the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in people with T2DM, from monotherapy through 
to insulin add-on in global populations, with another two trials dedicated to Japanese population. Over periods 
of treatment up to 104 weeks, once weekly tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (1.87% to 
3.02%), body weight (5.4 to 12.9 kg) and improved multiple cardiometabolic risk factors (including reduction in 
liver fat, new-onset macroalbuminuria, blood pressure, and lipids) across the T2DM spectrum. Tirzepatide pro -
vided better efficacy than placebo and other commonly used glucose-lowering medications such as semaglu -
tide 1 mg, dulaglutide, insulin degludec, and glargine. All tirzepatide doses were well tolerated with similar side-
effect profile to the GLP-1 receptor analogues. In people without diabetes, tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg once weekly 
for the treatment for obesity (SURMOUNT-1) resulted in substantial reductions in body weight (16.5% to 22.4%) 
over 72 weeks. Overall, the SURPASS program and SURMOUNT-1 study suggest that tirzepatide is marking a 
new era in T2DM and/or obesity management through dual agonism of gut hormones.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of obesity has almost tripled since 1975, in parallel 
with an increase in the cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).1,2 
Obesity is the strongest risk factor for T2DM as it causes insulin re -
sistance, a key driver in development of T2DM.3 Overweight and 
obesity account for 44% of T2DM cases worldwide and prevalence 
of obesity-related diabetes is expected to increase further over the 
next years.3-5 Both obesity and T2DM are associated with multiple 
metabolic complications such as increased cardiovascular risk, hy -
pertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, and nonalco -holic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).3 Considering the close relation -
ship between obesity and T2DM, weight loss (WL) in people with 
T2DM can have beneficial effects on glycemic levels, insulin sensi -
tivity, and cardiometabolic complications.3,6 Indeed, the latest Amer -
ican Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of 
Diabetes (ADA/EASD) consensus guidelines for T2DM recom -
mend 5% to 15% WL as a key component of care to improve quali -
ty of life and prevent complications.7 
Although 5% WL is associated with metabolic benefits, it is the 
sustained WL of ≥ 10% which provides maximum benefit for pre -
vention of T2DM and could reverse the underlying pathophysiolo -

gy of T2DM.8,9 In people with obesity diagnosed with T2DM for 
≤ 6 years, 64% of those who achieved and maintained ≥ 10 kg WL 
with a low calorie diet were able to achieve T2DM remission at  
2 years (Diabetes Remission Clinical T rial [DiRECT] study) and 
remission rates were higher the more the WL achieved.9 Addition -
ally, although an intensive lifestyle intervention for WL in the Look 
AHEAD: Action for Health in Diabetes (LookAHEAD) trial did 
not show reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-
4) in people with T2DM and obesity compared to a diabetes edu -
cation and support program, a post hoc  analysis demonstrated that 
those who lost ≥ 10% of their baseline body weight during the first 
year of the trial had a 21% lower risk for cardiovascular events over 
a 10 years follow-up period compared to those with stable weight 
or weight gain.10,11 Collating these results, it appears that ≥ 10% WL 
for people with obesity and T2DM is associated with improvements 
in glycemia, reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors as well as car -
diovascular benefits, providing a WL threshold which facilitates 
achieving multiple key components of care in this population.
However, even with the most intensive lifestyle interventions 
only a minority of people with T2DM will be able to achieve and 
maintain ≥ 10% WL long-term.9,12 Weight regain is common after 
lifestyle interventions and approximately 80% of weight lost is ex -
pected to be regained over the next 5 years.13 Bariatric surgery was 
until recently the only intervention which could lead to sustained 
WL ≥ 15%, however it is not scalable to the population level.14 
Over the last few years, glucagon-like peptide‐1 receptor analogues 
(GLP-1 RAs) have helped to transform the management of T2DM 
by combining effective reductions in glycemia with clinically im -
portant WL and weight maintenance.7 GLP-1 RAs also improve 
multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, reduce risk of cardiovascular 
events and cardiovascular mortality and have renoprotective effects 
in people with T2DM.15,16 Due to their efficacy in inducing WL and 
weight maintenance through reduction of appetite, some GLP-1 
RAs (liraglutide and semaglutide) have been repurposed and ap -
proved at higher doses as treatments for obesity.17-19 Liraglutide 3 mg 
in combination with a moderate intensity lifestyle interventions can 
lead to 5.8% to 8.0% WL at 56 weeks (Satiety and Clinical Adiposi -
ty—Liraglutide Evidence in Nondiabetic and Diabetic Individuals 
Obesity and Prediabetes [SCALE] program) as well as weight main -
tenance after intensive lifestyle interventions.17,18,20,21 Additionally, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly resulted in 14.9% to 17.4% WL in 
people without diabetes (STEP program).19,22,23 However, the effi -
cacy of GLP-1 RAs can be limited (mainly regarding WL in people 
with T2DM) and their adverse events (nausea and vomiting) are 
generally dose-dependent.21,24,25 As a result, a considerable number 
of people with T2DM are not able to achieve the metabolic, and 
WL targets with the currently existing therapies.26
THE CONCEPT OF CO-AGONISTS IN 
GLUCOSE-LOWERING AND WEIGHT LOSS 
TREATMENTS
In the search for the next step beyond GLP-1 RAs as treatment 
for T2DM and/or obesity, the combination of GLP‐1 with other 
gut hormones (including glucose-dependent insulinotropic poly -
peptide [GIP], amylin and glucagon) as dual or triple agonists has 
been trialled to complement and enhance further the metabolic 
benefits of GLP-1 by addressing multiple different mechanisms of 
action.27 The therapeutic potential of the combination of gut hor -
mones (as dual or even triple agonists) is supported by the remark -
able efficacy of bariatric surgery on WL and glycemia, an interven -
tion leading to increased levels of multiple gut hormones with dif -
ferent actions, as well as from multiple preclinical studies and emerg -
ing clinical data.28,29 The combination of GLP-1 and GIP (the “twin -
cretin” concept), appeared as one of the most attractive strategies 
for treating T2DM, considering that both these hormones have 
glucose-lowering actions.
GLP-1 AND GIP COMBINATION
The incretin effect describes the phenomenon whereby oral glu -
cose elicits higher insulin secretion than does intravenous glucose, 
despite inducing similar levels of glycemia, in healthy individuals.30 
This effect is mediated by the gut hormones GLP-1 and GIP which 
both promote insulin secretion and is uniformly defective in pa -
tients with T2DM.30,31
GLP-1 is secreted predominantly from L cells located in the ile -
um and colon in response to food intake.32 Exogenous GLP-1 infu -
sion induces multiple glucose-lowering actions (Fig. 1) such as 
stimulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion, delay in gastric

emptying and inhibition of glucagon secretion in healthy individu -
als as well as in people with T2DM.32-35 Additionally, exogenous 
GLP-1 infusion results in reduced food intake and appetite without 
direct changes in energy expenditure.35,36
On the other hand, GIP is a peptide secreted by K cells in the 
duodenum and jejunum in response to nutrient ingestion. In peo -
ple without diabetes, GIP stimulates insulin secretion but does not 
change glucagon release during hyperglycemia, whereas it increases 
glucagon release without affecting insulin secretion during hypo -
glycemia.37,38 In the context of T2DM, the ability of GIP to stimu -
late insulin secretion and to ameliorate glycemia is impaired; how -
ever, GIP sensitivity can be restored after improvement of glycemic 
control.39,40 GIP retains also the ability to stimulate glucagon secre -tion in people with T2DM and unlike what is reported in healthy 
people, subjects with T2DM demonstrate increased glucagon se -
cretion in response to GIP during hyperglycemia.41 Other actions 
of GIP include increased lipogenesis and enhancement of the lipid-
buffering capacity of the white adipose tissue, reduction of nausea 
and inhibition of bone resorption (Fig. 1).42-44 Preclinical studies 
have also shown that GIP receptor agonism lowers body weight 
through reduction of food intake.45
In preclinical models, the simultaneous administration of GLP-1 
and GIP receptor agonists reduced food intake, body weight, and 
fat mass in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) to a greater ex -
tent than either agent alone, suggesting an additional effect.28,46 
Further preclinical experiments showed that the combined activa -Figure 1.  Pancreatic and exopancreatic actions of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide‐1 (GLP-1). *Evidence from preclinical studies.

tion of both GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists had superior glucose-
lowering efficacy compared to activation of either receptor alone.47,48 
The greater metabolic effects observed with combined GLP-1 and 
GIP receptor activation in preclinical studies increased the interest 
for the development of unimolecular agonists of GLP-1 and GIP 
receptors, despite that this additive effect in glucose-lowering and 
food intake was not observed in some acute clinical studies.49,50
TIRZEPATIDE: PRECLINICAL STUDIES 
AND EARLY PHASE CLINICAL TRIALS
Tirzepatide, a once weekly unimolecular dual agonist of GLP-1 
and GIP receptors, consists of 39 amino-acids and is the first dual 
gut hormone-based agonist which has been approved for the treat -
ment of T2DM.51
Preclinical studies revealed that tirzepatide has a binding affinity 
to the GLP-1 receptor which is five times less than the native GLP-
1, while it has comparable affinity to the native GIP for its recep -
tors.52 Tirzepatide was also shown to induce glucose-dependent in -
sulin secretion both in vitro  and in vivo  through actions on both in -
cretin receptors. Chronic treatment with 10 nmol/kg of tirzepatide 
in DIO mice produced a dose-dependent decrease in body weight 
which was greater than with 30 nmol/kg semaglutide, primarily 
driven by a loss of fat mass due to reduction in food intake and a 
small increase in energy expenditure.53
Phase 1 clinical trials investigated the safety and tolerability of 
tirzepatide both in healthy people and people with T2DM. Phar -
macokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tirzepatide as well as chang -
es in glycemic parameters and WL compared to placebo and the 
GLP-1 RA dulaglutide were also assessed in these early phase tri -
als.53 The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide supported once weekly 
administration.53 Moreover, safety and good tolerability of tirzepa -
tide in doses up to 15 mg once weekly was shown both in healthy 
people and those with T2DM, with gastrointestinal side effects be -
ing the most commonly reported.2,53,54 Dose and time-dependent 
reductions in body weight were observed across phase 1 studies 
and were greater than those observed with dulaglutide 1.5 mg at  
29 days both for healthy individuals and for people with T2DM.2,53,54 
Similarly, in people with T2DM, the reductions in glycosylated he -
moglobin (HbA1c) were dose-dependent.53Based on these findings, a randomised, double blind, placebo 
controlled phase 2 study was carried out in people with T2DM 
treated with lifestyle measures or metformin, aiming to assess the 
safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in comparison with placebo and 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg once weekly.55 Over 26 weeks, HbA1c im -
proved by 1.6% to 2.4% with tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg compared to 
1.1% reduction with dulaglutide and 0.1% HbA1c increase with 
placebo. WL was 4.8% to 11.3% over 26 weeks with tirzepatide 5 
to 15 mg, with more than 20% of participants at tirzepatide 10 and 
15 mg groups achieving WL ≥ 15% compared to 2% of those on 
dulaglutide.55 Adverse events were mainly mild or moderate in se -
verity, with gastrointestinal symptoms being the most common. 
There were more gastrointestinal adverse events at the 15 mg tirz -
epatide group compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg.55 A separate, phase 
2, dose-escalation study found that by reducing the starting dose 
and increasing dose-escalation time to 8 weeks, gastrointestinal side 
effects could be reduced and study dropout rates were similar to 
that of placebo.56
POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF ACTIONS 
OF TIRZEPATIDE
Mechanistic studies have shown that tirzepatide 15 mg leads to 
significant improvements in β-cell function and insulin sensitivity 
together with reduced glucagon secretion compared to placebo in 
people with T2DM.57 These actions, can explain at least partially 
the marked improvements in glycemia observed with tirzepatide in 
people with T2DM (Fig. 2).58 Moreover, tirzepatide 15 mg once 
weekly results in reduced energy intake (–348.4 kcal) at an ad libi -
tum lunch in people with T2DM through reduction of the overall 
appetite, increased satiety and decreased prospective food con -
sumption, which explains the reduction in weight.59 Further mech -
anistic studies assessing the changes in resting metabolic rate, ener -
gy intake and appetite with tirzepatide in people without T2DM 
(NCT04081337) as well as how it affects the appetite- and reward-
related areas of the brain (NCT04311411) are ongoing.
SURPASS PROGRAM: METHODOLOGY
The results of the phase 2 trial led to the SURPASS program 
Sinha R, et al. Tirzepatide for Type 2 Diabetes and ObesityJ Obes Metab Syndr 2023;32:25-45 https://www.jomes.org | 29
(composed of multiple phase 3 clinical trials) and seven randomised 
controlled trials have been published so far. Five of these were 
global multicenter trials, and two regional studies were carried out 
in Japan.60-66 Baseline demographics of participants and study de -
signs of SURPASS program are presented in T able 1.
Individuals recruited to SURPASS covered a large part of the 
T2DM continuum, ranging from those with less than 5 years since 
diagnosis to those with advanced disease ( > 10 years). Participants 
were given subcutaneous tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg once weekly 
either as monotherapy, or in combination with other glucose-low -
ering medications, including insulin, without additional support for 
lifestyle changes.67 Tirzepatide initiation dose was 2.5 mg once 
weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until reaching the target dose (a lower starting dose and a slower escalation regime 
compared to the phase 2 trial).68
The effect of tirzepatide was assessed against placebo, basal insu -
lins (glargine and degludec) and the GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide 0.75 mg 
and semaglutide 1 mg. The primary endpoint in all these studies 
was the change in HbA1c from baseline, except of SURPASS in 
Japanese population (SURPASS J-mono) which aimed to evaluate 
the safety of tirzepatide in the study population. The primary out -
come was reported using two estimands for most studies, the effi -
cacy estimand, and the treatment-regimen estimand. The efficacy 
estimand excludes data on the treatment after rescue therapy or 
discontinuation of study drugs. The treatment-regimen estimand 
represents efficacy of treatment regardless of study drug discontin -

SURPASS PROGRAM: CLINICAL OUTCOMES
Glycemic outcomes
Tirzepatide reduced HbA1c in a dose-dependent manner across 
all the studies using both estimands (T able 2, Fig. 3).60-66 In people 
with early T2DM treated only with diet and exercise (SURPASS-1), 
tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg improved the HbA1c by 1.87% to 2.07% 
compared to 0.04% increase at the placebo group.60 
In SURPASS-2, people with established T2DM treated with tirz -
epatide 5 to 15 mg for 40 weeks and achieved HbA1c reduction 
2.09% to 2.46% compared to 1.86% reduction with semaglutide  
1 mg.61 Similarly, in SURPASS-3, tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg for 52 weeks 
resulted in 1.93% to 2.37% HbA1c reduction versus 1.34% decrease 
with insulin degludec.63
In people with advanced T2DM ( > 10 years) and increased car -
diovascular risk (SURPASS-4), the use of tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg 
also decreased HbA1c by 2.24% to 2.58% compared to insulin 
glargine which improved HbA1c by 1.44% at 52 weeks.62 In SUR -
PASS-5, when tirzepatide was added in people who were already 
on insulin glargine, it led to 2.23% to 2.59% reduction in HbA1c 
versus 0.93% with placebo—this improvement in glycemia was 
also associated with a reduction in insulin use.64 
In Japanese populations, tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg decreased HbA1c 
by 2.4% to 3.02% after 52 weeks of treatment.65,66 Tirzepatide was 
also more effective for glycemic control compared to dulaglutide 
0.75 mg once weekly in this population.
More patients in the tirzepatide groups achieved the HbA1c tar -
gets of < 7%, ≤ 6.5%, and < 5.7% both in the global and Japanese 
SURPASS studies compared to placebo or active comparators (T a -
ble 2).60-66 
Fasting serum glucose (FSG) was lower with tirzepatide across all 
doses and studies (–43.6 to –74.4 mg/dL or –2.4 to –4.1 mmol/L) 
compared to baseline levels as well as compared to placebo, sema -
glutide 1 mg, and dulaglutide 0.75 mg ( J-mono) (T able 3). In 
SURPASS-3, the FSG reduction with all tirzepatide doses was com -
parable to the FSG achieved with insulin degludec, when in SUR -PASS-4, only the 15 mg tirzepatide dose produced a significant 
FSG reduction compared to insulin glargine.60-66,68
Continuous glucose monitoring in a subgroup of participants in 
SURPASS-3, showed that all tirzepatide doses (5, 10, and 15 mg) 
improved the time in range (TIR, 70 to 180 mg/dL or 3.9 to  
10 mmol/L) (TIR increased by 32% to 40% from baseline, achiev -
ing overall 85% to 91% TIR) compared to insulin degludec (TIR 
increased by 22% from baseline, achieving overall 75% TIR) at  
52 weeks after randomisation.70 The tirzepatide groups had also 
less time below range ( < 70 mg/dL or < 3.9 mmol/L) compared 
to insulin and reduced glycemic variability.70
Weight outcomes
Marked WL was seen in all tirzepatide groups across the SUR -
PASS program (Fig. 2).60-66 In people with early onset T2DM,  
40 weeks of tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg led to WL of 7 to 9.5 kg com -
pared to 0.7 kg WL with placebo.60 
In people with established T2DM, larger WL was achieved across 
all tirzepatide doses (–7.8, –10.3, and –12.4 kg with 5, 10, and 15 mg, 
respectively) compared to semaglutide 1 mg (–6.2 kg, SURPASS-2).61 
Initiation of insulin degludec in SURPASS-3 caused weight gain of 
2.3 kg after 52 weeks of treatment, whereas tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg 
reduced weight by 7.5 to 12.9 kg.63
In people with advanced T2DM, initiation of insulin glargine on 
a background of other glucose-lowering medications (SUR -
PASS-4) led to weight gain of 1.9 kg after 52 weeks compared to 
7.1 to 11.7 kg WL with tirzepatide.62 In SURPASS-5, all the partici -
pants were on basal insulin glargine and the tirzepatide group 
achieved 6.2 to 10.9 kg WL compared to 1.7 kg weight gain with 
placebo.64
In Japanese populations, tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg resulted in 3.8 to

baseline with all tirzepatide doses. At week 52, LFC was reduced 
by 29.78% to 47.11% with tirzepatide compared to baseline, 
whereas it was reduced less (11.17%) with insulin. Notably, 67% to 
81% of people treated with tirzepatide reached at least 30% relative 
reduction in LFC, a degree of response associated with improve -

by 1 to 5.6 mmHg across the programme. Pulse rate was found to 
increase (0.7 to 8.3 beats/minute on average), a similar magnitude 
to that seen with use of GLP-1 RAs.60-66,68 
INITIAL EVIDENCE ON CARDIOVASCULAR 
AND RENAL SAFETY
SURPASS-4 assessed the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide vs in -
sulin glargine in a high cardiovascular risk population with ad -
vanced T2DM over a period of 2 years.62 Cardiovascular outcomes 
were assessed (as secondary outcome) using a composite of 
MACE-4 consisting of: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, and hospitalisation for unstable angina. Adjudicated 
MACE-4 events were not increased in tirzepatide groups com -
pared to insulin glargine (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.51 to 1.08).62
A pre-specified cardiovascular meta-analysis included seven clini -
cal trials with follow-up at least 26 weeks and compared the time to 
first occurrence of MACE-4 between pooled tirzepatide (n = 4,887) 
and control groups (n = 2,328).72 In a population with one-third 
having established cardiovascular disease, there were 142 partici -
pants who experienced at least one MACE-4 event after treatment 
for just over a year. The HRs comparing tirzepatide versus controls 
were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.11) for MACE-4; 0.90 (95% CI, 0.50 
to 1.61) for cardiovascular death; and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.25) 
for all-cause death.72 These results suggest that there is no excess 
cardiovascular risk with tirzepatide use; however, the exact impact 
of tirzepatide on cardiovascular outcomes in people with T2DM 
and established cardiovascular disease will be addressed in the on -
going A Study of Tirzepatide Compared With Dulaglutide on Ma -
jor Cardiovascular Events in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes 
(SURPASS-CVOT) study (NCT04255433).
An exploratory post hoc  analysis of SURPASS-4 showed that tirz -
epatide delayed the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) decline and reduced the urine albumin to creatinine ratio 
(UACR) compared with insulin glargine in people with T2DM 
and high cardiovascular risk.73 At baseline, participants had a mean 
eGFR of 81 mL/min/1.73 m2 and a median UACR of 15 mg/g 
(17% of participants had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 28% had 
microalbuminuria, and 8% had macroalbuminuria).73 The mean rate of eGFR decline was –1.4 mL/min/1.73 m2/year at the com -
bined tirzepatide groups versus –3.6 mL/min/1.73 m2/year at the 
insulin group. UACR increased from baseline with insulin glargine 
(by 36.9%) but not with tirzepatide (–6.8%; between-group differ -
ence –31.9%).73 Participants on tirzepatide had lower occurrence 
of the composite kidney endpoint (time to first occurrence of eGFR 
decline of at least 40% from baseline, end-stage kidney disease, death 
due to kidney failure, or new-onset macroalbuminuria) compared 
with those who received insulin glargine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 
to 0.8) and this finding was mainly driven by a reduction in new-
onset macroalbuminuria.73
SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY
Tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg was largely well tolerated and serious 
adverse events during the SURPASS programme were reported by 
1% to 8% of participants with early or established diabetes (SUR -
PASS 1-3, SURPASS J-mono, and SURPASS J-combo) and by 6% 
to 17% of people with advanced diabetes (SURPASS 4-5)—these 
percentages were similar to the number of serious adverse events 
reported in placebo and active comparator groups (T able 4). The 
majority of adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, and com -
parisons with semaglutide and dulaglutide show that these are simi -
lar to GLP-1 RAs. Most of the adverse events were mild-moderate 
in severity, dose-dependent and occurring during dose-escalation 
and reducing thereafter. There were very few cases of pancreatitis 
or cholelithiasis, and injection site reactions were also rare.60-66,68
Incidence of clinically important/serious hypoglycemia (blood 
glucose < 54 mg/dL) was low at tirzepatide groups in SURPASS 
1-3, SURPASS J-mono, and combo (0% to 2%) (T able 4).60,61,63,65,66 
In SURPASS-4, a high proportion of participants were on sulfo -
nylureas (54%); however, the incidence of serious hypoglycemia 
in the tirzepatide groups (6% to 9%) was lower than that observed 
with insulin glargine (19%).62 On the other hand, in SURPASS-5 
where all the participants were on background insulin glargine, 
the rates of serious hypoglycemia in the tirzepatide groups were 
higher (14% to 19%) compared to the placebo group (13%).64 In 
summary, treatment with tirzepatide does not appear to increase 
the risk of hypoglycemia unless it is combined with insulin or sul -
fonylurea.

TIRZEPATIDE AS TREATMENT FOR 
OBESITY IN PEOPLE WITHOUT DIABETES
At the recently published SURMOUNT-1 study, 2,539 partici -
pants with obesity or overweight were randomised to tirzepatide 5, 
10, or 15 mg or placebo along with a moderate intensity lifestyle 
intervention.74 At 72 weeks, the mean WL was 16% to 22.5% in 
tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg groups versus 2.4% WL in the placebo group 
(T able 2). The 31.6% to 62.9% of participants treated with tirzepa -
tide 5 to 15 mg achieved ≥ 20% WL and 16.5% to 39.7% achieved 
≥ 25% WL compared to 1.3% and 0.3% with placebo, respectively.74 More than 95% of people with prediabetes converted to normogly -
cemia (HbA1c < 5.7%) at 72 weeks, as compared to 62% of partic -
ipants in the placebo group.74
Cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference, blood pres -
sure, and lipids), inflammatory markers, and the physical function 
were all improved with tirzepatide compared to placebo in SUR -
MOUNT-1 (T able 3).74
The most reported adverse events were similar to those at SUR -
PASS program (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation) (T a -
ble 4). Only 4.3% to 7.1% of participants taking tirzepatide discon -
tinued the medication due to adverse events. In SURMOUNT-1, Table 4.  Adverse events in the SURPASS and SURMOUNT-1 studies

cholecystitis was reported more frequently with tirzepatide com -
pared to placebo (overall incidence was still low < 0.6%), possibly 
due to the considerable weight reduction with the medication.74
DISCUSSION
The WL (5.4 to 12.9 kg) and the improvement in glycemic con -
trol (1.87% to 3.02% HbA1c reduction) achieved with tirzepatide 
in SUPRASS programme suggests that we are entering a new era in 
T2DM pharmacotherapy where ≥ 10% WL and even ≥ 15% WL 
together with HbA1c ≤ 6.5% are feasible targets, independent of 
background glucose-lowering agents and even in people with  
> 10 years of T2DM duration. In all the clinical trials with active 
comparators (basal insulins and once weekly GLP-1 RAs such as 
dulaglutide up to 1.5 mg and semaglutide 1 mg), tirzepatide was 
more efficacious not only in improving glycemia, but also in achiev -
ing clinically significant WL and improving multiple cardiometa -
bolic risk factors. Based on these findings, the latest ADA/EASD 
2022 consensus guidelines for T2DM recommend tirzepatide as a 
treatment with very high efficacy in helping people achieving both 
the glycemic and WL targets; however, data on cardiovascular out -
comes with tirzepatide is currently limited compared to other glu -
cose-lowering medications with known cardio-protective actions 
such as GLP-1 RAs and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors.7 The ongoing SURPASS-CVOT trial will provide defi -
nite evidence on the effect of tirzepatide on cardiovascular outcomes 
in people with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, but 
until then GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovas -
cular benefits remain the recommended glucose-lowering treatments 
for people with T2DM and pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovas -
cular disease or very high cardiovascular risk.7
In SURPASS-2, tirzepatide was compared to the GLP-1 RA sema -
glutide 1 mg which is also considered a treatment with very high 
efficacy for WL and glycemia improvement in people with T2DM. 
A composite outcome of (1) an HbA1c ≤ 6.5% together with (2) 
≥ 10% WL and (3) without episodes of severe or clinically signifi -
cant hypoglycemia was achieved by 22% of participants at the sema -
glutide 1 mg group, compared to 32% to 60% at the tirzepatide 5 to 
15 mg groups after 40 weeks of treatment, demonstrating the po -
tential of tirzepatide to improve further the current management of people with T2DM and obesity compared to the currently used 
GLP-1 RAs.61 Mechanistic studies have shown significant improve -
ments in insulin sensitivity, β-cell function as well as reduction in 
glucagon secretion with tirzepatide 15 mg compared to semaglu -
tide 1 mg in people with T2DM, which can explain the better effi -
cacy of tirzepatide in improving glycemia.57 On the other hand, the 
reduction in energy intake during an ad libitum lunch (buffet style) 
with tirzepatide 15 mg (–348.4 kcal) was not significantly different 
compared to semaglutide 1 mg (–284.1 kcal, P= 0.19) which may 
suggest that mechanisms other than reduced food intake and appe -
tite are contributed to the more WL observed with tirzepatide 15 mg 
versus semaglutide 1 mg.59 An adjusted indirect treatment compari -
son between semaglutide 2 mg (the highest approved semaglutide 
dose for T2DM treatment) and tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg also showed 
that tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg reduced the weight (by 3.15 to 5.15 kg) 
and HbA1c (by 0.36% to 0.4%) significantly more compared to 
semaglutide 2 mg.75 
The exact molecular mechanisms behind the more powerful ther -
apeutic effects of tirzepatide in glycemic control and WL versus 
GLP-1 RA comparators are still under investigation.28 One hypothe -
sis is that GLP-1 activity lowers glucose levels, facilitating the ef -
fects of GIP on re-sensitised β-cells76; however, other GLP-1/GIP 
dual agonists have not produced the same results as tirzepatide.77 
Tirzepatide appears also to act as a biased agonist compared to 
GLP-1, with little β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internaliza -
tion, which may explain the superior activity on target cells.76 
In studies where T2DM treatment was escalated to tirzepatide vs 
initiation of basal insulin (SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-4), the esti -
mated treatment difference regarding weight between the two groups 
was between 9.0 and 15.3 kg. The better glycemic control com -
pared to basal insulin seems to be mainly due to the reduction of 
postprandial hyperglycemia.70 Moreover, in SURPASS-4, WL and 
improvement in HbA1c was maintained for 2 years with tirzepatide, 
providing some initial evidence for sustained improvements over 
time.62,68
In SURPASS-5, tirzepatide was added to background basal insu -
lin and there was an increase in episodes of hypoglycemia compared 
to placebo—clinicians may wish to consider reducing the dose of 
basal insulin by at least 20% on initiation of tirzepatide for people 
with HbA1c < 8% and adjusting the dose of sulfonylureas.64 The 
Sinha R, et al. Tirzepatide for Type 2 Diabetes and ObesityJ Obes Metab Syndr 2023;32:25-45 38 | https://www.jomes.org
ongoing SURPASS-6 study will also assess the safety and efficacy 
of adding tirzepatide versus prandial insulin lispro three times/day 
in people with T2DM who are already on basal insulin (Fig. 4).
SURPASS J trials showed that the Japanese population tended to 
have greater HbA1c reductions with tirzepatide than the global 
population (from similar baselines), which may be due to differenc -
es in β-cell function and decreased insulin resistance in Asian popu -
lations compared to White populations.65,68 
Based on the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide in people with im -
paired kidney function, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment.78 However, there is very limited 
data with tirzepatide in people with severe renal impairment as 
SURPASS program (except from SURPASS-4 study) excluded 
participants with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. An exploratory 
analysis of SURPASS-4, demonstrated that tirzepatide may have 
renoprotective actions compared to insulin glargine and these ben -
efits were more pronounced in people with impaired kidney func -
tion, supporting the design of future clinical trials with tirzepatide 
in people with pre-existing kidney disease.73

therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and macular edema have 
not been studied in the SURPASS program and for these patients 
tirzepatide should be used with caution and appropriate monitor -
ing. Similarly, tirzepatide should be used with caution for those with 
a history of pancreatitis as this population has been excluded from 
the SURPASS studies.
Further research is also needed to establish the most appropriate 
time points in the T2DM continuum to initiate tirzepatide in dif -
ferent populations. For people with severe obesity (body mass in -
dex ≥ 35 kg/m2) and T2DM, evidence from bariatric surgery sug -
gests that the earlier after the T2DM diagnosis that significant WL 
is achieved and maintained, the lower is the long-term risk for de -
veloping micro- and macrovascular complications.79 However, wheth -
er tirzepatide will lead to similar outcomes to bariatric surgery and 
whether this will be a cost-effective approach requires further as -
sessment.
In people with obesity without T2DM, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg 
for 72 weeks resulted in 35.0% to 39.7% achieving ≥ 25% WL. 
Though tirzepatide has not yet been approved for treatment of 
obesity, these results suggest that it may be more efficacious than 
semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly (an approved treatment for obesi -
ty) in people without diabetes, and it approaches the effectiveness 
of sleeve gastrectomy.80 Lean muscle mass maintenance for people 
who achieve large amounts of WL with tirzepatide may become a 
challenge and the addition of exercise may help to improve body 
composition and physical function. The ongoing SURMOUNT 
program will assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide as treat -
ment for chronic weight management in combination with differ -
ent lifestyle interventions and in different populations. 
FUTURE STUDIES WITH TIRZEPATIDE
The safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in populations with T2DM 
from the Asian-Pacific region will be evaluated at the A Study of 
Tirzepatide in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes on Metformin 
With or Without Sulfonylurea (SURPASS-AP-Combo). As dis -
cussed before, the SURPASS-CVOT will assess the non-inferiority 
and superiority of tirzepatide against dulaglutide 1.5 mg on cardio -
vascular safety in people with T2DM and confirmed atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (Fig. 4).Looking at the SURMOUNT program, the efficacy of tirzepa -
tide for weight management in people with overweight/obesity 
and T2DM will be assessed in SURMOUNT-2. The ability of tirz -
epatide to maintain or add to WL achieved after an intensive lifestyle 
modification program will be investigated in SURMOUNT-3 when 
the SURMOUNT-4 will assess the effect of continuing tirzepatide 
vs switching to placebo on WL maintenance in adults with over -
weight or obesity. The A Study of Tirzepatide in Chinese Partici -
pants Without Type 2 Diabetes Who Have Obesity or Overweight 
(SURMOUNT-CN) and the SURMOUNT-J studies will evaluate 
tirzepatide as treatment for obesity in Chinese and Japanese popu -
lations without diabetes. 
The effect of tirzepatide on morbidity and mortality in a high 
cardiovascular risk population living with obesity (without diabetes) 
will be assessed at the A Study of Tirzepatide on the Reduction on 
Morbidity and Mortality in Adults With Obesity (SURMOUNT-
MMO) trial. Until today, no pharmacological intervention for chronic 
weight management has demonstrated reduction in major cardio -
vascular events in people living with obesity without diabetes; the 
Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients With 
Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) trial with semaglutide 2.4 mg 
once weekly is also expected to be completed in September 2023.
Apart from the SURPASS and SURMOUNT programs, the im -
pact of tirzepatide in people with heart failure with preserved ejec -
tion fraction and obesity and in people with nonalcoholic steato -
hepatitis will be assessed at the SUMMIT and A Study of Tirzepa -
tide (LY3298176) in Participants With Nonalcoholic Steatohepati -
tis (NASH) (SYNERGY-NASH) trial, respectively.
FURTHER POTENTIAL TREATMENTS FOR 
OBESITY AND T2DM
Beyond the GLP-1 and GIP co-agonism, multiple gut hormones 
are undergoing early phase clinical trials in combination with GLP-
1 (as dual or triple agonists) as potential treatments for obesity and 
T2DM.81-84 
Glucagon, a peptide secreted from pancreatic α-cells, which in -
creases the blood glucose but also reduces energy intake and in -
crease the energy expenditure could complement and enhance the 
WL actions of GLP-1.85 Currently, dual agonists acting on both 
Sinha R, et al. Tirzepatide for Type 2 Diabetes and ObesityJ Obes Metab Syndr 2023;32:25-45 40 | https://www.jomes.org
GLP-1 and glucagon receptors (BI 456906 and SAR428599) are 
undergoing early phase clinical trials as treatments for T2DM and 
obesity.86 
The clinical success of dual GLP-1/GIP agonism with tirzepatide 
on WL may also be surpassed by including glucagon receptor ago -
nism. T riple agonists acting on GLP-1, GIP , and glucagon receptors 
(such as LY3437943 and SAR441255) have shown encouraging 
results in preclinical studies as well as in phase 1 clinical trials in 
terms of safety, tolerability, WL, and glucose-lowering effect.87,88 
Another promising combination of gut hormones which has pro -
gressed to phase 3 trials (A Research Study to See How Well CagriSe -
ma Helps People With Type 2 Diabetes and Excess Body Weight 
Lose Weight [REDEFINE 2], NCT05394519) is the Cagri-Sema 
(2.4 mg/2.4 mg), a combination of semaglutide 2.4 mg with a new 
once weekly amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg. Amylin agonism 
reduces the appetite and food intake and has also glucose-lowering 
actions by slowing the gastric emptying and suppressing glucagon 
secretion.89 In a phase 1b study, cagrilintide 2.4 mg in combination 
with semaglutide 2.4 mg led to 17.1% WL at 20 weeks compared 
with 9.8% loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg plus placebo with good 
tolerability.82
In the near future, there is a real prospect for gut hormone com -
binations to deliver improved outcomes over the currently available 
treatments for T2DM and obesity.
CONCLUSION
The efficacy and safety of once weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide 
in people with T2DM and/or obesity is supported by a growing 
body of evidence through the SURPASS and SURMOUNT clini -
cal trial programmes. Tirzepatide marks a new era in the pharma -
cotherapy of T2DM and/or obesity where double digit WL and 
maintenance together with excellent glycemic control and optimi -
sation of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors is feasible through 
combination of gut hormones. Additional research assessing long-
term cardiovascular safety and effectiveness of tirzepatide as well  
as its potential impact on other cardiometabolic complications is 
awaited over the next years to help us understand better its posi -
tion in the treatment algorithms for people with T2DM and/or 
obesity. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
