Objective: Little is known about the predictors of response to obesity 
interventions.
Methods: In 450 participants with obesity, body composition, resting en-
ergy expenditure, satiety, satiation, eating behavior, affect, and physical activity were measured by validated studies and questionnaires. These variables were used to classify obesity phenotypes. Subsequently, in a 12- month, pragmatic, real- world trial performed in a weight management 
center, 312 patients were randomly assigned to phenotype- guided treat-
ment or non- phenotype- guided treatment with antiobesity medications: 
phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, bupropion/naltrexone, lorcaserin, and liraglutide. The primary outcome was weight loss at 12 months.Results: Four phenotypes of obesity were identified in 383 of 450 par -
ticipants (85%): hungry brain (abnormal satiation), emotional hunger (he-donic eating), hungry gut (abnormal satiety), and slow burn (decreased metabolic rate). In 15% of participants, no phenotype was identified. Two or more phenotypes were identified in 27% of patients. In the prag-matic clinical trial, the phenotype- guided approach was associated with 
1.75- fold greater weight loss after 12 months with mean weight loss of 
15.9% compared with 9.0% in the non- phenotype- guided group (differ -
ence −6.9% [95% CI −9.4% to −4.5%], P < 0.001), and the proportion of 
patients who lost >10% at 12 months was 79% in the phenotype- guided 
group compared with 34% with non- phenotype- guided treatment group.
Conclusions: Biological and behavioral phenotypes elucidate human 
obesity heterogeneity and can be targeted pharmacologically to enhance weight loss.

Introduction
Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, multifactorial disease (1), the prevalence of which contin-
ues to increase worldwide (2). The complexities of obesity result in redundant, adaptive mechanisms to preserve energy (1); consequently, obesity is a remarkably heterogeneous 
disease, and sustained weight loss with current treatment paradigms remains a challenge in 
clinical practice (3,4). The heterogeneity among patients with obesity is particularly appar -
ent in the varied weight loss response to obesity interventions, such as diets, medications, devices, and surgery (1).

Study Importance
What is already known?
►	Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, 
 multifactorial disease, the prevalence of 
which continues to increase worldwide. Obesity is a remarkably heterogeneous 
disease, and sustained weight loss with 
current treatment paradigms remains a challenge in clinical practice.
►	The heterogeneity among patients with obe-sity is particularly apparent in weight loss 
response to obesity interventions, such as 
diets, medications, devices, and surgery.
►	Little is currently known about the predic-tors of response to obesity interventions.
What does this study add?
►	We stratified obesity into four pheno-types: hungry brain (abnormal satia-tion), emotional hunger (hedonic eating), 
hungry gut (abnormal satiety), and slow 
burn (decreased metabolic rate).
►	In a clinical cohort prescribed antiobes-ity medication, the phenotype- guided 
approach was associated with 1.75- fold 
greater weight loss after 1 year, and the proportion of patients who lost >10% at 1 year was 79% compared with 34% with non- phenotype- guided treatment.
How might these results change the 
direction of research or the focus of clinical practice?
►	We have identified actionable pheno-
types of obesity based on pathophysiol-ogy and behavior that elucidate human 
obesity heterogeneity and can be tar -
geted to enhance weight loss outcomes 
of pharmacotherapy.

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Thus, antiobesity medications (AOMs) have a variable weight loss 
response rate (1,5). In a network meta- analysis, the proportion of patients 
who lost more than 10% with AOMs ranged from 20% to 54% compared 
with placebo (9%), and weight loss at 1 year with AOMs ranged from 
2.6 to 8.8 kg compared with placebo (5). Early response, defined as >5% 
weight loss in the first 3 months, is the only current predictor of long- term 
weight loss with AOMs (6,7). Thus, the current standard of care is for 
providers to initially select AOMs based on physician/patient preference, 
medication interactions, comorbidities, risk of potential adverse events, 
or insurance coverage (1,8,9). Other than identifying responders by trial 
and error (6,7), little is currently known about the predictors of response 
to obesity interventions (3).
Current obesity classifications based on BMI (10), abnormal waist 
circumference, metabolically abnormal obesity (11), or the obesity staging system (12) identify cardiometabolic disease and mortality 
risk. However, these severity- based classifications or staging systems 
predominantly address cardiometabolic risk and do not address patho-
physiological or etiological heterogeneity of obesity (13- 15). There is a 
critical need to develop a valid classification of obesity based on patho-genesis and to ascertain its utility in obesity management to improve 
outcomes (1,16). In fact, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has 
recognized the need to identify predictors of response to obesity treatment as a key approach to successfully manage this epidemic. The NIH’s initiative, titled “Accumulating Data to Optimally Predict Obesity Treatment Core Measures” (17), aims to collect data on behav-
ioral, biological, environmental, and psychosocial variables to identify 
predictors of response (17). To date, interrogations of large databases from biobanks or clinical trials have not identified predictors of signifi-cantly improved clinical outcomes to treatment (3).
Obesity is a disease of energy balance dysregulation (1) (Figure 1A) 
that results in excessive storage of calories in the form of fat (1). With 
regard to energy intake, the key determinants of eating behavior are the homeostatic and hedonic drives to eat (18). Homeostatic eating behavior, mainly controlled by the brain- gut axis, involves hunger 
(desire to eat), satiation (calories needed to reach fullness), and satiety (duration of fullness) (19). Hedonic eating behavior is the desire to 
eat to cope with positive or negative emotions (20,21). With regard to energy expenditure, the key drivers are resting energy expenditure (REE), nonexercise physical activity, and the thermogenic effect of food and exercise (22). It is essential to elucidate differences among patients in some of these measurable components of food intake and energy expenditure and to assess their potential for individualizing therapy for obesity.
We hypothesized that pathophysiological characterization elucidates 
obesity subgroups and enhances response to obesity pharmacotherapy. Our aim was to characterize the obesity phenotypes and to assess the efficacy of phenotype- guided AOMs compared with non- phenotype- 
guided pharmacotherapy. Our long- term goal is to develop a personal-
ized approach to obesity management.
Methods
Study participants and phenotyping tests
We studied two separate cohorts: (1) obesity phenotype characteriza-tion and classification (n = 450 participants) and (2) prospective, prag-
matic trial of phenotype- guided AOMs (n = 84 cases and 228 controls). 
The studies were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent.
Obesity phenotyping tests
Participants were recruited from the community by standard adver -
tising, and all the tests were performed at the Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Trials Unit after an 8- hour fasting period. All methods used 
are described in detail in the online Supporting Information.
All participants completed the following validated tests:1. Homeostatic eating behavior (18) was divided into three stages: 
hunger, satiation, and satiety.

Obesity Phenotypes Enhance Weight loss Acosta et al.a Hunger, defined as desire to eat (23), studied by visual analog 
scale for hunger and desire to eat (100- mm scale) at baseline be-
fore breakfast and lunch.
b Satiation, defined as calories consumed to reach fullness and ter -
minate meal (23), studied by ad libitum buffet meal (kilocalories consumed to reach maximal fullness) (24).
c Satiety, defined as duration of fullness or return of hunger (23), 
studied by visual analog scale for appetite (100- mm scale) at 
baseline and postprandially every 15 minutes for 2 hours after 
a standard 320- kcal meal (23,25) and by a quantifiable variable 
gastric emptying of solids that could impact both magnitude of postprandial fullness and time to return of hunger (26- 28). 
Gastric emptying is summarized by the half- emptying time, T
1/2, 
in minutes.
2. Hedonic eating behavior (18) was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Score (HADS) (26) and Three Factor Eating 
Questionnaire (TFEQ- 21) (29); there is significant correlation be-
tween HADS and the emotional eating domain of the TFEQ- 21 
(30). Emotional eating was assessed by additional validated behav-
ioral questionnaires (24,29,31).
3. Energy expenditure was studied by REE (indirect calorimetry) 
(32), reported nonexercise physical activity, and reported exercise (33,34). Body composition was measured by dual- energy x- ray ab-
sorptiometry (35).
Obesity phenotype classification
Obesity phenotype classification was based on a cutoff of the 25th or 75th percentile of each measurement (applied separately for females and males) recorded in the first 100 participants who completed phe-
notype measurements (Table 1). The cutoffs were as follows: abnormal 
ad libitum buffet meal: 75th percentile for females >894 kcal and males >1,376 kcal, defined as “hungry brain”; abnormal behavioral question-naire for anxiety: 75th percentile for both genders ≥7 points on HADS scale, defined as “emotional hunger”; accelerated gastric emptying of the radiolabeled solid 320- kcal, 30% fat meal: 25th percentile for fe-
males <101 minutes and males <86 minutes, defined as “hungry gut”; and measured REE: 25th percentile for females <96% and males <94% 
of predicted REE based on Harris- Benedict equation, defined as “slow 
burn.” Visual analog scales for appetite were not considered in the clas-
sification because of small interindividual variability when measuring satiation and the lack of correlation with calories consumed, a more objective measurement. These cutoffs were applied in order to classify 
the phenotype(s) on the other 350 participants in the first study aim. See 
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines checklist in online Supporting Information.
Phenotype- guided antiobesity pharmacotherapy
Patients with obesity were recruited between June 1, 2017, and June 30, 2019, for a comprehensive, prospective, pragmatic trial (36) of phenotype- guided AOMs in a multidisciplinary weight loss clinic. 
Patients were assigned appointments to physician groups that selected AOM treatments based on phenotype or to physicians who recom-mended AOMs based on their own and/or patient preferences or re-lated comorbidities; the latter approach was defined as standard of care 
for AOM selection (1,8,9). Thus, this design constituted a pragmatic, 
real- world study. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
(CONSORT) flow of participation and allocation of treatment appears in Supporting Information Figure S1. See the CONSORT- extension 
guidelines checklist in Supporting Information (36).
The multidisciplinary program in the Obesity Clinic involves a team 
of providers, registered dietitians, and behavioral psychologists. The detailed description of the weight management program is provided in 
online Supporting Information. Participants in the phenotype- guided 
group had their phenotype measured by clinically available tests (sati-
ation test [nutrient drink test]; satiety test [gastric emptying by scin-tigraphy]; emotional hunger [validated questionnaires]; and energy

expenditure [indirect calorimetry REE]). Participants in the nonpheno-
typed group had no test prior to medication selection.
Rationale for a priori phenotype- guided AOM approach.   
Treatment decisions in the phenotype- guided group were determined by 
an a priori management approach based on the medications’ predominant 
mechanism of action (9) and supported by previously completed 
randomized, placebo- control trials (26,37,38). Those prior trials showed 
that a phenotype- tailored application may predict best responders for 
the following medications: phentermine- topiramate extended release for 
the hungry brain phenotype (26) and exenatide and liraglutide for the hungry gut phenotype (37,38). Lorcaserin was selected for the hungry brain phenotype as the predominant mechanism of action is to induce satiation by activating (5- HT)
2C  receptors in the hypothalamus (9). 
Naltrexone/bupropion sustained release was selected for the emotional hunger phenotype as bupropion is a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitor  and naltrexone is an  opioid receptor agonist; together they 
modulate appetite, mood, and cravings (9). Phentermine was selected for the slow burn phenotype for its secondary effect on energy expenditure (9).
Based on the obesity phenotype classification, AOMs were selected as 
follows:
1. abnormal satiation (“hungry brain”): phentermine- topiramate 
extended release (Qsymia, Campbell, California) at a dose of 
7.5/46 mg daily or lorcaserin (Belviq, Arena Pharmaceuticals, 
San Diego, California) at 20 mg daily (patients were told to discontinue in February 2020 based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] recall);
2. abnormal hedonic eating (“emotional hunger”): oral naltrexone/bu-propion sustained release (Contrave, Nalpropion Pharmaceuticals, Morristown, New Jersey ) at a dose of 16/180 mg twice daily;
3. abnormal satiety (“hungry gut”): liraglutide (Saxenda, Novo Nordisk, Plainsboro, New Jersey) 3 mg subcutaneous daily; or
4. low predicted energy expenditure (“slow burn”): phentermine 15 mg daily plus increased resistance training.
When patients had two or more phenotypes, the providers selected the 
medication based on the predominant phenotype. Patients were excluded 
if no phenotype was identified, when patients had contraindications, or if there was a lack of insurance coverage for the “assigned” medication.
Design of clinical trial and eligibility criteria.  We report the 
outcomes of 84 patients who received phenotype- guided treatment 
compared with 228 patients who received standard of care weight loss 
treatment with medications not based on phenotype characterization.
Participants included in the analysis met these inclusion criteria: (1) 
patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with adiposity- related comorbidities 
or patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 with or without adiposity- related 
comorbidities; (2) patients prescribed FDA- approved AOMs; (3) fol-
low- up of at least 3 months; and (4) two or more face- to- face visits 
with one of the physicians at the Mayo Clinic Weight Management Program.
We excluded all patients who (1) had prior major gastrointestinal sur -
gery, (2) had prior endoscopic weight loss intervention, (3) did not 
fill the medication prescription because of health insurance coverage denial and/or high drug cost, and (4) were taking FDA- approved AOMs 
prior to the first visit to the Mayo Clinic Weight Management Program, because such a prior prescription may conceivably confound the weight loss outcomes. All the information was collected from physician’s doc-umentation, including outcomes and adverse events.
End points and statistical analysis
In the pragmatic trial, the primary end point was the percentage of total body weight loss (TBWL) during 1- year follow- up. Secondary end 
points included the proportion of patients who had a reduction from 
baseline body weight of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, and ≥ 20%. See online 
Supporting Information materials and protocol for details.
All continuous data are summarized as means and SEMs or group mean 
differences with 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise stated. 
Categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages. We used unpaired two- tailed t test for between- group comparisons for baseline 
nominal and ordinal variables and χ² for categorical variables. Additional 
details of sample size, primary and secondary end points, and detailed 
statistical analysis are provided in the Methods section of the online 
Supporting Information. P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Obesity phenotypes classification
We studied a total of 450 participants with obesity (defined as BMI > 30 kg/m
2) with the following demographics (mean [SEM]): age 
39 (0.5) years old, BMI 37 (0.3) kg/m2, 72% females, 93% White, 
waist circumference 105 (0.1) cm, and fasting glucose 103 (1.4) mg/dL (Table 2). We classified obesity in four distinct phenotypes: hungry brain 
(abnormal satiation), emotional hunger (hedonic eating), hungry gut 
(abnormal satiety), slow burn (decreased metabolic rate), and no phe-notype. The phenotype distribution and overlap are shown in Figure 1B.
The prevalence of each phenotype was hungry brain 32% (n = 143/450), 
emotional hunger 21% (n = 96/450), hungry gut 32% (n = 144/450), slow 
burn 21% (n = 82/400), and no identified phenotype 15% (n = 68/450). 
Two or more phenotypes were documented in 27% of patients (mixed 
group). The prevalence of participants with only one phenotype was 
hungry brain 16%, emotional hunger 12%, hungry gut 18%, and slow 
burn 12% (Figure 1B). Among these phenotype groups, there were statistical differences in gender (ANOV A P < 0.01) and race (ANOV A 
P < 0.01), with the percentage of males being higher in the hungry gut 
and slow burn phenotypes and the percentage of White race being lower in the hungry gut compared with the other groups. There was no sta-tistical difference in age, height, body weight, BMI, waist or hip cir -
cumference, pulse, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and prevalence of comorbidities (Table 2).
Based on the selected cutoffs in each phenotype, the differences in 
each phenotype compared with participants without that specific phe-notype were as follows: the hungry brain group consumed 62% more 
calories prior to reaching fullness; the emotional hunger group reported 
2.8 times higher levels of anxiety; the hungry gut group emptied the stomach contents 31% faster; and the slow burn group had 12% lower predicted REE when compared with the other groups of obesity (Table 2 and Figures 2A- 2D).
Individuals with the emotional hunger obesity phenotype had higher levels of symptoms of anxiety (P < 0.001), symptoms of depression 
(P < 0.001), emotional restraint– TEFQ21 (30% higher, P = 0.04), and 
emotional eating (Disinhibition on the Eating Inventory, P = 0.007)

Obesity Phenotypes Enhance Weight loss Acosta et al.and lower levels of self- esteem (P = 0.002) and body image (P < 0.001) 
compared with non- emotional- eating obesity phenotypes.
In female participants with hungry gut obesity, the mean gastric emp-
tying T 1/2 was accelerated by 30% for solids (P < 0.001) and by 22% 
for liquids (P = 0.01) compared with non- hungry- gut obesity among 
females. In male participants with hungry gut obesity, mean gastric emp-
tying T 1/2 was accelerated by 38% for solids (P < 0.001) and 33% for 
liquids (P = 0.05) compared with non- hungry- gut obesity among males.
Participants with slow burn obesity had a lower muscle mass (non- slow 
burn obesity phenotype 50.7% ± 0.6%, compared with slow burn obesity 
phenotype 46.7% ± 0.7%, P < 0.001), reported to be less frequently active 
(P = 0.048), less engaged in structured exercise (P = 0.05), and among those 
who engaged in structured exercise, they performed exercise for fewer 
minutes (P = 0.04) compared with participants with non- slow burn obesity.
Pragmatic trial of phenotype- guided compared 
with standard of care selection of AOMs
Participant characteristics.  There were statistical differences in 
the demographics and comorbidities among the groups. Patients in the phenotype- guided group were younger (mean difference 7.2 years 
[95% CI −4 to −10.4], P < 0.001) and had lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) (mean difference 6.2 mmHg [95% CI −11 to −1.5], P = 0.01) 
and lower fasting glucose (mean difference 21 mg/dL [95% CI −37 to −3.2], P = 0.02) compared with the nonphenotyped (standard of 
care use of medications) group (Table 3). There were no statistically significant differences in gender, race, anthropometric measurements, 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), number 
of comorbidities, average length of follow- up, or number of visits 
with providers, psychologists, and registered dietitians between the phenotype- guided group compared with the non- phenotype- guided 
group (Table 3). Importantly, there was no statistically significant 
difference in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (phenotype- guided group, 
25% compared with the non- phenotype- guided group, 29%, P = 0.41). 
In patients with a prior diagnosis of diabetes, the HbA1c was lower in 
the phenotype- guided group compared with the non- phenotype- guided 
group (mean difference 1.2% [95% CI −2 to −0.3], P = 0.02). There was 
no difference in fasting glucose or number of diabetes medications used among the groups (Supporting Information Table S1).
In the phenotype- guided group, the prevalence of participants’ pheno-
types was hungry brain (40%), emotional hunger (30%), hungry gut 
(18%), and slow burn (12%), and medications were selected for each 
phenotype as described in the methods. In the nonphenotyped group, medications were selected based on AOM side effect profile (30%), glycemic control (21%), patient preference (16.5%), cravings (10%), TABLE 2  Participant characteristics including demographics, anthropometric measurements, and comorbidities in all the

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
When adjusted for age, gender, HbA1c, and SBP, the mean weight loss 
difference at 12 months was −13.6% (2.2%) in the phenotype- guided 
group compared with −6.6% (1.1%) in the nonphenotyped group (mean 
difference −6.97 [95% CI −12.1 to −1.9], P = 0.009). Baseline pheno-
type and HbA1c were the only significant covariates.
Adverse events.  There were no significant differences in AOM-  
induced adverse events among the groups. There was a numerically 
lower incidence of adverse events to phentermine and liraglutide 
in the phenotyped group (14%) compared with the nonphenotyped 
group (30%).
Discussion
Our study of participants with obesity has shown clinically meaningful phenotype- based groups identified by validated biological and behav-
ioral testing of the key components of energy balance. This phenotype- 
based classification reduces the heterogeneity of obesity and facilitates 
further understanding of the pathophysiology within each phenotype. Phenotype- guided obesity pharmacotherapy enhanced weight loss in a 
precision medicine, pragmatic trial.
Despite considerable attempts to address the obesity heterogeneity 
and predictors for weight loss in the literature, there are no established predictors of response to obesity interventions (3,16). The phenotype-  
based classification proposed addresses, at least in part, the underlying 
pathophysiology of energy balance and considers gender as the initial 
key variable in obesity phenotype stratification. We identify within four obesity- related phenotypes the associated pathophysiological perturba-
tions that underpin, at least in part, the phenotype as summarized here: 
(a)“hungry brain,” characterized by excessive calories consumed to ter -
minate meal; (b) “emotional hunger,” characterized by negative mood, 
emotional eating, cravings, and reward- seeking behaviors, despite having 
normal homeostatic eating behavior (39); (c) “hungry gut,” characterized by reduced duration of fullness, quantified objectively by rapid gastric emptying; and (d) “slow burn,” characterized by reduced REE, reduced 
reported physical activity and exercise, and with lower muscle mass.
Fifteen percent of participants did not meet the criteria for any sin-
gle phenotype, which suggests that more variables must be studied to fully understand the complexity of obesity in a minority of patients. 
Furthermore, the fact that 27% of participants have two or more phe-
notypes of obesity illustrates this complexity, which may indicate that some patients with obesity might need combination therapy to treat the underlying aberrant mechanisms (40).
The utility of the phenotype- based classification of obesity is sup-
ported by the observed responses to phenotype- guided weight loss 
therapy. Currently, FDA- approved AOMs are usually prescribed 
based on physician and patient preferences, related comorbidities, 
insurance coverage, or potential risk profile (1,8,9). Here, we propose a new treatment approach whereby phenotypes guide AOM selection, based on and in accordance with the mechanism of action (9). This is 
supported by prior experience from three prior single- center, random-
ized, double- blinded, placebo- controlled clinical trials that identified 
best responders according to the phenotypes of increased food intake 
and accelerated gastric emptying (24,35,37). Thus, the proposed phenotype- guided approach consists of using the FDA- approved 
AOMs based on potential mechanism of action in relation to the 
phenotype(s): phentermine- topiramate extended release for hungry 
brain, bupropion- naltrexone sustained release for emotional hunger, 
liraglutide for hungry gut, and low- dose phentermine plus resis-
tance training for the slow burn phenotype. In the current pragmatic 
clinical trial, with this a priori– defined approach, we observed that 
phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy more than doubled the responder 
rate when adjusted for age, gender, SBP, and HbA1c and increased the total weight loss by an average 75% compared with standard care, which also used the AOMs without consideration of the phenotype.
These outcomes require replication and validation in larger, more 
racially and metabolically diverse cohorts, preferably in multicenter, Figure 3  PG pharmacotherapy for obesity management improves weight loss outcomes. (A) Percentage of patients achieving levels of weight

Obesity Phenotypes Enhance Weight loss Acosta et al.randomized studies. However, the real- world, pragmatic trial design 
may be perceived as a strength of the study, which may accelerate the 
applicability of the research findings to patient management and AOM 
selection. Additional studies are needed to identify best responders for participants with two or more phenotypes or those with no phenotype, 
which may require a low- calorie diet challenge to trigger a metabolic 
adaptation or weight- loss- induced phenotype. Additional, further stud-
ies are needed to understand whether AOMs with multiple mechanisms 
of action may have a positive outcome in other phenotypes, for exam-ple, using bupropion- naltrexone sustained release to induce satiation 
(41) or liraglutide for food cravings (42). However, the benefits seen 
with a phenotype- guided approach over standard of care warrant the 
additional testing in the management of obesity. Such confirmation 
would be a step toward a mechanistic and evidence- based, personalized 
approach to obesity. Furthermore, this classification may also reduce the stigma associated with obesity (43), reduce or eliminate the trial and error (standard of care) selection for AOMs, potentially increase 
provider confidence and patient engagement in the treatment journey, and facilitate patient– provider discussion and individualized choice of 
treatment for obesity.
We perceive that other etiologies of obesity may be considered in future 
pathophysiological classifications, and therefore it is essential to further 
interrogate the roles of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and expo-
some in obesity phenotypes, and in outcomes to obesity treatments, including nonpharmacological approaches. Additionally, the outcome 
with phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy has limitations that deserve 
further studies in the future, including appraising a “testing” bias such that participants who underwent additional testing may be conditioned 
to greater responsiveness based on clinical education and consent, lack of blinded randomization, and potential group- difference confounders 
such as age and comorbidities. Despite these limitations, the weight loss 
difference was almost doubled when adjusting for potential confound-
ers. It is worth noting that there was persistent weight loss observed in 
this pragmatic trial in both groups of patients and that there was con-
tinued weight loss with AOM treatment administered for 12 months. 
A prior real- world report of AOM efficacy has shown similar effects 
of continued weight loss at 6 months (44), which differs from larger 
randomized trials in which weight loss is typically seen in the first 3  months (1,5- 7). However, early response seems to also determine 
overall weight loss over 12 months in the phenotype- guided approach 
to AOM treatment, as previously described in randomized trials (6,7).
In summary, we have identified actionable phenotypes of obesity based 
on pathophysiology and behavior that elucidate human obesity hetero-
geneity and that can be targeted to enhance weight loss outcomes of 
pharmacotherapy. This phenotype- based classification reduces the het-
erogeneity of obesity, and it may serve as a valuable tool to understand 
the pathogenesis that leads to human obesity and to accelerate the trans-
lation of discovery into phenotype- specific targeted trials. In the era of 
individualized medicine, the proposed phenotype- guided stratification 
and treatment approach, in addition to the positive outcomes reported in previous randomized trials (24,35,37), represents a step toward a mech-
anistic, precision medicine approach to optimize obesity therapy.O
