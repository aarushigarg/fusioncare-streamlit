Aim: To compare the efficacy of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg with semaglutide 2.4 mg
using an indirect treatment comparison.
Materials and Methods: Using SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 trial data, mean percent-
age change in body weight from baseline and odds ratio (OR) of achieving 5% or
greater weight loss were compared between tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg at week 72 andsemaglutide 2.4 mg at week 68 using matching-adjusted indirect comparison of the
efficacy estimand. Sensitivity analyses were completed using different methods, includ-
ing the Bucher method, also using different estimands and/or time points.
Results: Greater reductions in percentage change in body weight were observed with
tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg (tirzepatide 10 mg mean differ-ence: /C04.67% [95% CI /C05.91%, /C03.43%]; tirzepatide 15 mg mean difference:
/C05.92% [95% CI /C07.16%, /C04.68%]; both P< .001). Similarly, more participants
achieved 5% or greater weight loss with tirzepatide 10 mg (OR 2.61 [95% CI 1.48,
4.57]; P< .001) and 15 mg (OR 2.75 [95% CI 1.57, 4.81]; P< .001) compared with
semaglutide 2.4 mg. All sensitivity analyses were consistent, except for an OR of
achieving 5% or greater weight loss with tirzepatide 10 mg using the Bucher method
to analyse the treatment regimen estimand ( P=.074).
Conclusions: Currently there are no direct comparisons of tirzepatide and semaglu-
tide for weight management. Using the matching-adjusted indirect treatment com-
parison method to compare the efficacy of tirzepatide and semaglutide for chronic
weight management, this analysis showed greater weight loss with tirzepatide
10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg.

1|INTRODUCTION
In the last 50 years, obesity has increased to pandemic levels.1
The pathogenesis of obesity is comp lex, involving sociocultural,
environmental, genetic, physiological and behavioural factors.Obesity is now recognized as a disease
2and treatments that induce
short-term weight loss often fail over time. Effective treatments are
needed to address the complex and persistent hormonal, metabolicand neurochemical adaptations; poor adherence; and persistence
experienced by those living with obesity.
1
Semaglutide 2.4 mg is a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) that was approved for chronic weightmanagement in June 2021.
3The phase 3 STEP 1 trial showed that, in
people with obesity or overweight (without diabetes), semaglutide
2.4 mg treatment resulted in 16.9% or 14.9% body weight loss usingthe efficacy and treatment regimen estimands, respectively, after
68 weeks of treatment with mostly mild or moderate adverse events
(the most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal).
4
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic poly-
peptide (GIP)/GLP-1 RA that was recently approved in the
United States for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D)and is in development for chronic weight management.
5In the phase
3 SURMOUNT-1 study of people with obesity or overweight (without
diabetes), tirzepatide treatment resulted in mean body weight reduc-tions of up to 22.5% or 20.9% using the efficacy and treatment regi-men estimands, respectively, at week 72, with mostly mild or
moderate adverse events (the most frequently reported adverse
events were gastrointestinal).
6
Currently, there are no head-to-head studies comparing tirzepa-
tide with semaglutide for chronic weight management. This study
aimed to use indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs)7,8using placebo
as the common comparator to provide evidence on the comparative
efficacy of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg. As
baseline characteristics such as gender, baseline body weight and pre-diabetes were hypothesized to be potential effect modifiers,
9a
population-adjusted indirect comparison was used to account for dif-
ferences in the study populations.2|METHODS
2.1 |Primary analysis
A systematic literature review was used to identify trials eligible for
inclusion in the ITC network comparing tirzepatide with semaglutide
2.4 mg with placebo as the common comparator. The PICOS criteria
and PRISMA diagram are provided in Table S1and Figure S1, respec-
tively. The systematic literature review identified three studies eligible
for inclusion: SURMOUNT-1, STEP 1 and STEP 8. STEP 8 was
excluded from the analysis based on the pooled placebo arm, whichincluded two placebo arms with different administration schedules.
10
By design, the pooling of placebo arms with different administration
schedules, as in STEP 8, may not be comparable with the
SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 placebo arms.
Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted
according to Signorovitch et al.11To reduce bias and enable valid treat-
ment comparison across trials, we weighted the individualSURMOUNT-1 patient data to match the aggregate data in STEP 1. Indi-
vidual patient data were not available for STEP 1, but were available for
SURMOUNT-1. Aggregate published data were used for STEP 1. Thekey baseline characteristics of the participants enrolled in
SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 are summarized in Table
1. The baseline
characteristics of patients enrolled in SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 wereassessed for differences, especially in variables that are possible effectmodifiers, including gender, prediabetes and baseline body weight.
MAIC weights individual patient data to match the characteristics of the
comparator's patient population to weight treatment effect modifiersthat differ between the studies. For the primary analysis, we matched
for gender because of it being considered the only variable to have dif-
fered meaningfully between the trials with a standardized difference of0.15. The rest of the baseline characteristics were quite balanced
between the two studies, with standardized differences of less than 0.1.
Baseline data for SURMOUNT-1 were reweighted using the method ofmoments to balance gender differences with semaglutide aggregatedata.
9The MAIC was anchored to the common placebo arm. Figure 1
shows the ITC network used in the primary and secondary analyses.

2.1.1 | Study and participant characteristics
Study characteristics and key inclusion criteria of the SURMOUNT-1
and STEP 1 trials are detailed in Table 1. Both trials were double-blind,
parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3, multinational
trials with the same key inclusion criteria of a body mass index (BMI)
of 30 kg/m2or greater, or a BMI of 27 kg/m2or greater with at least
one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes.4,6In
SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1, background therapy to the treatment and
placebo arms involved lifestyle interventions, including regular life-style counselling sessions, a deficit of 500 calories per day and at least150 minutes of physical activity per week. There was a difference
between the studies regarding the timing of the primary endpoint
(72 vs. 68 weeks for SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1, respectively) (Table
2). The titration of tirzepatide to 15 mg per week was 4 weeks longer
than the titration to semaglutide 2.4 mg per week. For the primary
analyses, the endpoints were compared at these two time points, con-sistent with the primary endpoints for these studies.
Primary outcomes were based on the efficacy estimand (referred
to as the ‘trial product estimand ’in the STEP programme). The effi-
cacy estimand represented the average treatment effect of tirzepatiderelative to placebo for all participants who had undergone randomiza-
tion, if the treatment was administered as intended (according to the
hypothetical strategy in the ICH E9 [R1] addendum14). For continu-ous outcomes, the relative treatment effect was evaluated with the
mean difference. For binary outcomes, the relative treatment effect
was evaluated with the odds ratio (OR).
MAIC was performed using R version 4.1.2.
2.2 |Outcomes
The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight
from baseline to week 72 (SURMOUNT-1) or week 68 (STEP 1) and thepercentage of participants achieving at least 5% weight reduction at week
72 (SURMOUNT-1) or week 68 (STEP 1). The predetermined primary
outcomes for SURMOUNT-1 were with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg; theoutcomes of the 5 mg dose were considered secondary endpoints. The
co-primary endpoints were controlled for type 1 error rate in both trials.
Mean treatment difference (95% CI) and OR (95% CI) are reported.2.3 |Sensitivity analysis
Six different sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robust-
ness of the findings of the primary analysis, as detailed in Table 3. The
efficacy estimand was the base case, whereas the treatment regimen
estimand was specifically evaluated in two sensitivity analyses. The
treatment regimen estimand (termed ‘treatment policy estimand ’in
STEP 1) assessed the average treatment effect of tirzepatide relative
to placebo for all participants who had undergone randomization,
regardless of treatment discontinuation. Week 72 (SURMOUNT-1)and week 68 (STEP 1) time points were the base case and other time
points were specifically evaluated in some sensitivity analyses. As
with the primary analysis, sensitivity analyses 1 and 2 were conductedwith the MAIC method. Sensitivity analysis 1 used the treatment regi-men estimand, while sensitivity analysis 2 compared 68-week data
from SURMOUNT-1 with 68-week data for STEP 1. To test the
robustness of the primary analysis and sensitivity analyses 1 and2, sensitivity analyses 3, 4 and 5 were conducted using the Bucher
method,
12where the relative treatment effect was directly calculated
with the aggregate data. Sensitivity analyses 3 and 5 used

SURMOUNT-1 week-72 data (sensitivity analysis 3) and week-68
data (sensitivity analysis 5). Sensitivity analysis 4 accounted for the
treatment regimen estimand. Sensitivity analysis 6 used the same
method (MAIC), estimand and analysis time as the primary analysis,reweighted for gender, prediabetes status and baseline weight. Allsensitivity analyses used week-68 data from STEP 1. Individual
patient weight data of SURMOUNT-1 at week 68 were imputed by
linear interpolation between individual weight data at week 60 andweek 72.
3|RESULTS
There were 1909 participants included in this analysis from the tirze-
patide 10 and 15 mg and placebo arms from the SURMOUNT-1 study(tirzepatide 10 mg, N=636; tirzepatide 15 mg, N=630; placebo,
N=643). There were 1961 participants included from STEP 1 (sema-
glutide 2.4 mg, N=1306; placebo, N=655).
After matching, baseline characteristics such as age, gender, body
weight, BMI, prediabetes and waist circumference were balanced
between the reweighted SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 populations withstandardized differences of less than 0.1 (Table
1).
Results of the comparison with placebo for percentage change
from baseline in body weight and percentage of participants achieving5% or greater body weight reduction from baseline at endpoint, as
reported in SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1, are shown in Table S2.

3.1 |ITC for percentage change in body weight
Primary analysis results showed tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg both
resulted in significantly greater reductions in percentage change in
body weight compared with semaglutide 2.4 mg (tirzepatide 10 mg
mean difference: /C04.67% [95% CI /C05.91% to /C03.43%]; tirzepatide15 mg mean difference: /C05.92% [95% CI /C07.16% to /C04.68%];
P< .001 for both) (Figure 2A).
The results from the sensitivity analyses (detailed in Table 3)
accounting for the treatment regimen estimand, SURMOUNT-1 dataat week 68, the Bucher method and/or adjusting for gender, baselineprediabetes status and baseline body weight, were consistent with
those of the primary analysis (Figure
2A). In particular, sensitivity anal-
ysis 1, which examined the treatment regimen estimand, showed amean difference of /C05.56% (95% CI /C06.90% to /C04.22%; P< .001)
between tirzepatide 10 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg and a mean differ-
ence of /C06.80% (95% CI /C08.14% to /C05.46%; P< .001) between tirze-
patide 15 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg.
3.2 |ITC for participants achieving 5% or greater
reduction in body weight from baseline
Primary analysis results showed that significantly more participants
achieved 5% or greater weight loss with tirzepatide 10 mg (OR 2.61,
95% CI 1.48 to 4.57; P< .001) and 15 mg (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.57 to
4.81; P< .001) compared with semaglutide 2.4 mg (Figure 2B).
The results from the sensitivity analyses (detailed in Table 3)
accounting for the treatment regimen estimand, SURMOUNT-1 data
at week 68, the Bucher method and/or adjusting for gender, baselineprediabetes status and baseline body weight, were consistent with
those of the primary analysis (Figure
2B). Sensitivity analysis 1, which
examined the treatment regimen estimand, showed ORs of 3.71 (95%CI 2.39 to 5.70; P< .001) and 4.14 (95% CI 2.66 to 6.49; P< .001)
between tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively, compared with sema-
glutide 2.4 mg. The only sensitivity analysis that did not show a signif-
icant OR of participants achieving 5% or greater weight loss wassensitivity analysis 4, which accounted for the treatment regimen esti-
mand using the Bucher method between tirzepatide 10 mg and sema-
glutide 2.4 mg using week-72 SURMOUNT-1 data ( P=.074).TABLE 3 Details of primary and sensitivity analyses

4|DISCUSSION
Semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide represent new classes of antiobe-
sity medications with powerful efficacy, with weight loss of 15% orgreater.
13This is the first comparison of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg with
semaglutide 2.4 mg on percentage change in body weight and partici-
pants achieving 5% or greater reduction in body weight from baseline inpatients with obesity and overweight and no diabetes. Across analyses,
additional weight reduction of 4.0%-5.6% and 5.4%-6.8% was observed
for tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively, compared with semaglutide2.4 mg. Consistent with this, partici pants were more probable to achieve
5% or greater body weight loss with either tirzepatide 10 or 15 mg than
semaglutide 2.4 mg. In the absence of a head-to-head trial, data on com-
parative efficacy can help providers make relevant clinical decisions tosupport individualized care once tirzepatide is approved for chronic
weight management
14and inform pharmacoe conomic assessments.Intentional weight loss has been shown to improve clinical out-
comes in people with obesity and addi tional benefits are observed with
greater weight loss. For example, sustained weight loss ranging from 5%
to 16% can result in clinically meaningful improvements in metabolichealth and weight-related complicatio ns, such as cardiovascular risk fac-
tors as well as quality of life, depression, genitourinary function and fertil-
ity, among others.
15,16Given the relationship between weight loss
magnitude and clinical outcomes benefit, it could be expected that the
difference in the magnitude of weig ht loss observed for semaglutide
2.4 mg (16.9%) and tirzepatide 15 mg ( 20.9%) in their respective clinical
trials could result in differential clinical benefits, although this will requirefuture research. In this ITC, the magnitude of difference in body weight
reduction was 4.7% and 5.9% with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively,
compared with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The best evidence for the impact ofweight loss on mortality and long-t erm outcomes will come from appro-
priately powered randomized controlled trials.Sensitivity analysis 6Sensitivity analysis 5Sensitivity analysis 3Sensitivity analysis 2Sensitivity analysis 4Sensitivity analysis 1Primary analysis

The mechanism(s) through which tirzepatide results in greater
body weight reduction than semaglutide 2.4 mg are not known. It isknown that semaglutide is a GLP-1 RA
17and tirzepatide shares this
property, while also activating GIP receptors.18GLP-1 acts both cen-
trally19and peripherally20to regulate body weight. Similarly, GIP
receptors are thought to regulate body weight by modulating appetite
and food intake based on their distribution and signalling in the cen-
tral nervous system.21–24Tirzepatide has also been shown to delay
gastric emptying, although the effect wanes with chronic treatment
and is not thought to be the key driver of weight loss.25For semaglu-
tide, findings on gastric emptying have been mixed.26–28Although the
exact properties of the medications that confer the differences in effi-cacy seen here are unknown, the different mechanisms of action are
one potential driver that can be considered in future research.
Studies in people with T2D are consistent with the results
observed here. In an open-label randomized clinical trial of partici-
pants with T2D, all doses of tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg) resulted in
greater reductions in body weight and HbA1c than semaglutide1 mg.
29Similarly, an ITC leveraging data from the SURPASS-2 and
SUSTAIN FORTE trials showed that tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg resulted
in significantly greater reductions in body weight and HbA1c thansemaglutide 2.0 mg, while no significant differences were observed
between tirzepatide 5 mg and semaglutide 2.0 mg.
14Although the tri-
als presented and compared here were not designed as weight losstrials and the doses of semaglutide differ, the results are largely con-sistent that tirzepatide confers larger reductions in body weight than
semaglutide.
Because of intrinsic difficulties in using ITCs to compare safety
and tolerability data arising from differences in the collection of safety
data, adverse events were not analysed. For example, safety data can
be collected using questionnaires with check boxes, open format, orinvestigator team verbal questioning. Moreover, the majority of the
SURMOUNT-1 trial was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic
(2019-2022), while STEP 1 was completed in early 2021. From themain study publications, similar percentages of participants reportedany adverse event for tirzepatide 10 mg (81.8%), tirzepatide 15 mg
(78.9%) and semaglutide 2.4 mg (89.7%), with gastrointestinal (nausea,
diarrhoea and constipation) being the most common.
4,6Although
recent work has established a link between gastrointestinal adverse
events and weight loss among GLP-1 RAs,30in both trials used in the
current analysis the gastrointestinal events were transient, mild tomoderate in severity, and occurred during the dose escalation period
of both studies, suggesting that they are not a key driver of weight
loss. Specifically, the rates of nausea, diarrhoea and constipationfor the tirzepatide doses were 31.0%-33.3%, 21.2%-23.0% and
11.7%-17.1%, respectively, whereas the rates of nausea, diarrhoea
and constipation for semaglutide 2.4 mg were 44.2%, 31.5% and23.4%, respectively.
This study had several strengths. A systematic literature review
was used to identify eligible studies. Two comparison methods —MAIC
and Bucher —were used to leverage similarities between the two
placebo-controlled study designs, inclusion criteria and populations.
MAIC specifically accounts for any differences in baselinecharacteristics of potential effect modifiers. The placebo group of
both studies was designed similarly with a prescribed 500-calorie defi-cit and 150-minute activity per week interventions. Notably, the
impact of the lifestyle intervention in both trials resulted in similar
body weight reductions of 2.4%. The similar results in the placebogroups of both studies indicate that the lifestyle interventions pre-
scribed resulted in similar outcomes. Similar baseline characteristics
were observed between the SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 populations,and the population sizes were also similar. Sensitivity analyses 1 and
4 used the treatment regimen estimand to account for the impact of
treatment discontinuation or the use of rescue therapy.
This study also had limitations. Only two studies were eligible for
inclusion in the analysis. Moreover, there was no access to the individ-
ual participant data for STEP 1 so aggregate data were used.
SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 had different study durations (72 vs.68 weeks), although sensitivity analyses 2 and 5 were conducted to
address this. No safety outcomes were formally compared because of
differences in the collection of such events across trials. The primaryoutcomes for both SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 were related to the
regulatory framework of achieving greater than 5% weight loss. This
amount of weight loss may no longer be clinically relevant, but analy-sis of the secondary outcomes of greater than 10%, greater than 15%,
and greater than 20% weight loss was beyond the remit of our analy-
sis. The present results do not provide information on the lower doseof tirzepatide 5 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg as the 5 mg dose wasnot included in the co-primary endpoint of the SURMOUNT-1 trial.
ITCs will not account for unmeasured confounders and other unob-
served differences between trials. As a result, findings cannot replacea direct head-to-head trial.
In conclusion, in this ITC, greater weight loss and better odds of
achieving 5% or greater body weight reduction were seen with tirze-patide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg. Primary analysis
results were supported by the sensitivity analysis results, which
accounted for different estimands, study endpoints and analyticalapproaches to minimize bias. In the absence of a direct head-to-headcomparison, these findings may guide clinical decisions and pharma-
coeconomic assessment of the most appropriate therapies for chronic
weight management in patients without diabetes once both treat-ments are approved for chronic weight management.
