Aim: We evaluated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) with once-weekly
semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity and their contribution to
weight loss (WL).
Materials and methods: AE analyses pooled data from the Semaglutide Treatment
Effect in People With Obesity (STEP) 1-3 trials for participants randomized to
68 weeks of semaglutide 2.4 mg (n =2117) or placebo (n =1262). WL was analysed
by presence/absence of GI AEs. Mediation analysis estimated WL effects mediated
by and unrelated to GI AEs. GI tolerability with semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance and
cessation after dose escalation was evaluated using STEP 4 data among 803 partici-pants tolerating 20 weeks of semaglutide run-in.
Results: GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, with most
frequently nausea (43.9% vs. 16.1% of participants), diarrhoea (29.7% vs. 15.9%),
All trials were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03548935, NCT03552757, NCT03611582 and NCT03548987).Received: 21 June 2021 Revised: 27 August 2021 Accepted: 7 September 2021

vomiting (24.5% vs. 6.3%) and constipation (24.2% vs. 11.1%). Most GI AEs with
semaglutide were non-serious (99.5% of AEs), mild-to-moderate (98.1%), transient andoccurred most frequently during/shortly after dose escalation. Few semaglutide-treated
participants (4.3%) permanently discontinued treatment for GI AEs. In STEP 1-3, mean
WL with semaglutide 2.4 mg was similar in participants without (9.6%-17.1%) versus
with GI AEs (11.4%-17.7%). Consistent with this observation, mediation analysis found
that GI AEs contributed little to semaglutide -induced WL: of the additional 7.6%-14.4%
WL with semaglutide versus placebo, <1 percentage point was mediated by GI AEs. In
STEP 4, semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance was well tolerated.Conclusions: GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, but
typically mild-to-moderate and transient. Semaglutide-induced WL was largely inde-
pendent of GI AEs.

1|INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease, leading to substantial burden on
individuals and health care systems worldwide.1,2Weight management
guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to lifestyleinterventions in patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m
2,o r
≥27 kg/m2with weight-related comorbidities.3-6
Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist
(GLP-1RA) indicated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and now approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration for weight management in people
with overweight or obesity at a once-weekly subcutaneous dose of2.4 mg.
7In the phase III Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with
obesity (STEP) 1-4 studies, weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated
substantial, clinically meaningful weight losses and improvements in car-diometabolic parameters and patient-reported outcomes.
8-11
Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse eve nts (AEs), most co mmonly mild-to-
moderate nausea, are a dose-dependent class effect of GLP-1RAs.12-14
We conducted a pooled analysis of the STEP 1-3 trials to evaluate the GI
AE profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg. In addition, we explored whether GI
AEs contributed to the weight-loss e ffects of semaglutide in STEP 1-3.
Data from the STEP 4 withdrawal trial were analysed separately andused to evaluate the incidence of GI AEs after achievement of the target
2.4 mg maintenance dose. These analyses may inform understanding of
both weight loss and GI tolerab ility with semaglutide 2.4 mg.
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Trial designs and populations
The STEP 1-4 trial designs have been published.8-11,15In brief,
STEP 1, 3 and 4 enrolled adults aged ≥18 years with a BMI
≥27 kg/m2(with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity) or ≥30 kg/m2,without diabetes. Participants in STEP 2 had a BMI of ≥27 kg/m2
plus T2D.
In STEP 1, semaglutide 2.4 mg wa sc o m p a r e dw i t hp l a c e b oo na
background of lifestyle intervention. In STEP 2, semaglutide 2.4 mg wascompared with placebo or semaglutide 1.0 mg, plus lifestyle intervention
(as semaglutide 1.0 mg was not developed for weight management, data
for this dose are included in File S 1). STEP 3 compared semaglutide
2.4 mg with placebo, as adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy. Studydesigns were similar, consisting of a 68-week, randomized, placebo-
controlled treatment period (Figur e S1), enabling pooling of data. The
68-week STEP 4 trial used a withdrawal design: after a 20-week run-inperiod with open-label semaglutide, participants were randomized to
continued semaglutide 2.4 mg versus switch to placebo (both as adjunct
to lifestyle intervention) (Figure S1). Only those who tolerated the2.4 mg dose at week 20 were eligible for randomization. All trials wereconducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.
2.2 |Study protocol and titration schedule
Each STEP trial included an initial dose escalation for semaglutide, with
initiation at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, increased at 4-weekly
intervals to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and finally 2.4 mg at week 16.8-11,15
Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg (i.e. would otherwise discontinue
treatment) were permitted to remain at lower maintenance doses, with
at least one attempt to re-escalate to 2.4 mg. Participants discontinuingtreatment prematurely remained in each trial.
AE information, including onset and end date, was collected through-
out each trial, using open-ended, non -leading verbal questions. Reported

latory Activities (Version 22.1) an d categorized based on severity andWHARTON ET AL. 95
seriousness, using stand ard definitions (File S1). AE incidence was assessed
as a supportive secondary safety endpoint in each trial.
2.3 |Statistical considerations
On-treatment GI AE incidence was evaluated in post-hoc analyses
performed using pooled STEP 1-3 data for semaglutide 2.4 mg andplacebo arms. STEP 4 was not included in the pooled analysis because
of the differences in study design. For AE analyses, participants were
considered to be on treatment if any dose of trial product was admin-istered within the previous 49 days. The percentage of participantsthat experienced GI AEs and the event rate per 100 patient-years of
exposure were adjusted using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights to
account for differences between trials.
16Median durations of GI AEs
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
The effect of GI AEs on weight loss was explored using two dif-
ferent post-hoc analyses:
1. A descriptive analysis of percentage change in body weight from
baseline to week 68 among participants who did or did not experi-ence GI AEs during STEP 1-3, using observed body weight data
from participants who were on treatment and had a body weight
assessment at week 68 (on treatment was defined as any dose oftrial product within the previous 2 weeks). Analyses were per-formed separately among participants with/without (i) any GI AEs
and (ii) a subset of common GI AEs that were probably considered
to influence weight loss (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting).
2. Mediation analysis used a natural effects model with imputation-
based estimation, as described previously.
17-19This analysis aimed
to separate the overall effects on body weight into effects medi-ated by GI AEs (indirect effects) and those unrelated to GI AEs
(direct effects), for the STEP 1-3 trials. Changes in body weight
were analysed addressing the effect of treatment (if taken asintended) using a mixed model for repeated measurements.
20
GI AE incidence in the STEP 4 trial was analysed with a methodologysimilar to that used for the STEP 1-3 pooled analysis, with the excep-tion that no adjustment of AE incidence or event rate was performed.
Data from participants able to tolerate the semaglutide 2.4 mg dose
during the 20-week run-in period who were subsequently randomizedwere used to evaluate the effect of continued semaglutide 2.4 mg or
cessation of treatment (switch to placebo) on GI AE incidence.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Demographics and baseline characteristics
(STEP 1-4)
In total, 2117 participants were randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg
and 1262 to placebo within the STEP 1-3 trials. In STEP 4, 902participants entered the initial 20-week semaglutide run-in period; of
these, 803 participants were subsequently randomized to continuedsemaglutide 2.4 mg (n =535) or placebo (n =268).
Baseline characteristics were similar in each trial, except that the
STEP 2 population included fewer female participants, had lower BMIand higher age and glycated haemoglobin compared with STEP 1 and
3 (Table S1). In STEP 4, participant characteristics at randomization
(week 20) were comparable between the continued semaglutide2.4 mg and placebo arms (Table S1).
The majority of participants randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg
remained on treatment at week 68 in STEP 1-3 (84.0%) and in STEP4 (94.2%). Among these, most were receiving 2.4 mg once weekly(STEP 1-3: 87.0%; STEP 4: 89.5%).
3.2 |Incidence, timing and severity of any type
of gastrointestinal adverse event (STEP 1-3 pooled
analysis)
A greater proportion of participants reported GI AEs in the
semaglutide 2.4 mg arm compared with placebo: 72.9% and 47.1%,respectively (Table S2). Most GI AEs were non-serious (99.5% of
AEs) and mild or moderate in severity (98.1%) (Table S2). Severe GI
AEs (namely nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting) werereported by more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm (4.1%of participants) compared with the placebo arm (0.9%) (Table S2). GI
AEs were reported more frequently within the dose-escalation
period, with the cumulative incidence of participants experiencingtheir first GI AE plateauing after week 20 (Figure 1A). Data for the
1.0 mg dose of semaglutide (STEP 2) are shown in Table S3 and
Figure S2.
3.3 |Incidence, timing and severity of most
common gastrointestinal adverse events(STEP 1-3 pooled analysis)
The most commonly reported GI AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg were
nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation (Table S2). Relative to
the placebo arm, the prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and
constipation in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm were elevated through-out the 68-week treatment period (Figure 2A-D). The prevalence of
nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm
peaked at about week 20 and decreased thereafter, with the mostprominent decline found for nausea (Figure 2A-C). Individual nau-
sea, diarrhoea and vomiting events were relatively short-lived: in
the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm, the median durations of nausea, diar-rhoea and vomiting were 8, 3 and 2 days, respectively, and weresimilar to placebo (Figure 2A-C). The median duration of constipa-
tion was longer: 47 days in the semaglutide arm and 35 days for
placebo, with the prevalence plateauing at approximately week10 (Figure 2D).96 WHARTON ET AL.
3.4 |Impact of gastrointestinal adverse events on
dose and treatment adherence (STEP 1-3 pooled analysis)
GI AEs led to dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption in
12.5% of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm versus 1.7% ofparticipants in the placebo arm. GI AEs led to permanent treatment
discontinuation in more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm
(4.3%) than in the placebo arm (0.7%), with most discontinuationsoccurring during the dose-escalation period in both arms (Figure 1B).
Almost all participants who experienced GI AEs in the semaglutide
2.4 mg arm continued and completed t he trial (95.5%), with a similar com-
pletion rate among those who did not experience GI AEs (93.0%). The pro-portion of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm who completed the
trials on treatment was similar for participants who experienced GI AEs(83.1%) and for those who did not (86.7%); most of these participants
(83.7% and 96.0%, respectively) we re receiving the 2.4 mg dose at week
68 (Table 1). Among the participants in the semaglutide arm who experi-
enced a dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption owing to GI
AEs, 74.0% subsequently completed the study on treatment(at completion, 60.2% reported taking a dose of ≥1.7 mg and 36.7% the
2.4 mg dose) (Table 1).

weight change was analysed in participants with or without any of the
three common GI AEs that were considered to possibly influence
weight loss (nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting) (Figure 3).
Mediation analysis found that the vast majority of the weight-loss
effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg were because of effects unrelated to GI
AEs. Overall, <1 percentage point of semaglutide-induced weight lossversus placebo was mediated by GI AEs, whether analysed based on
the occurrence of any GI AE (Figure 4A) or the occurrence of nausea,
diarrhoea and/or vomiting (Figure 4B). There was no notable differ-ence in the magnitude of weight loss effect mediated by GI AEsbetween the STEP 1, 2 and 3 trials (Figure 4).
3.6 |Effect of treatment maintenance on
gastrointestinal adverse event incidence (STEP 4)
Of the 902 participants enrolled in the initial 20-week run-in period,
71.4% reported GI AEs, with type, severity and chronology similar
to that reported in STEP 1-3 (Table S2; Figure 2E-H). In total,99 participants (11.0%) enrolled in the run-in did not attain the tar-
get dosage required to participate in the randomized period at week
20, with AEs cited as the most common reason (48 of 99 partici-pants [48.4%]) .
Among the 803 participants randomized at week 20, GI AEs with
onset during the randomized period were reported in 41.9% of partici-
pants receiving continued semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment, comparedwith 26.1% of participants that switched to placebo (Table S2). In par-
ticipants receiving continued semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment, the prev-
alence of nausea, diarrhoea and constipation decreased over time, andthe prevalence of vomiting remained low (Figure 2E-H).
Almost all cases of permanent treatment discontinuation because
of GI AEs occurred during the run-in period (in 44 enrolled partici-pants [4.9%]). After randomization, few participants in either armexperienced dose adjustments or temporary or permanent discontinu-
ations of treatment because of GI AEs (Table S2).
4|DISCUSSION
These analyses provide a robust assessment of the GI tolerability of
semaglutide 2.4 mg in /C242650 adults over 68 weeks and show that
weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was mostly attributable toeffects unrelated to GI AEs.
Pooled data from the STEP 1-3 trials demonstrate frequent
reports of GI AEs in both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, withnausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation the most common sideeffects with semaglutide. The relatively high incidence of GI AEs in
the placebo arms was not unexpected and may in part reflect the
known underlying increased risk of GI disorders associated with obe-sity.
21While not assessed directly in our study, crude comparison of
the incidences of GI AEs reported in the individual STEP 1, 2 and3 trials8-10indicates between-trial variation in incidences for both
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, which may reflect trial-specificdifferences in design and patient populations.
Although GI AEs occurred more frequently with semaglutide
2.4 mg than with placebo across STEP 1-4, the vast majority of GI AEsreported were non-serious and mild-to-moderate in severity, and did
not necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation. GI AEs were most
prevalent during or shortly after dose escalation, declining in preva-lence thereafter. While rates of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting with
semaglutide remained elevated compared with placebo throughout
treatment, participants typically recovered from each event within afew days. Constipation tended to last longer, and may be because ofthe effects of GLP-1RAs on GI motility.
22Among the participants who
reported any GI AEs, the vast majority experienced their first event
during the dose-escalation period, suggesting that the elevated preva-lence of GI AEs with semaglutide versus placebo after dose escalation
is primarily because of additional events being reported by partici-
pants who have previously experienced a GI AE. Collectively, theseresults should reassure patients and physicians alike that GI AEs asso-
ciated with semaglutide 2.4 mg are unlikely to be serious and will typi-
cally be transient, although a small proportion of patients maycontinue to experience GI AEs throughout treatment. Importantly, in
STEP 1-3, only 4.3% of participants in the semaglutide arm discon-
tinued treatment prematurely because of GI AEs, with very few dis-continuations occurring after dose escalation.
STEP 4 provides additional insight and reassurance on the GI tol-
erability profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg. Participants able to tolerate
semaglutide 2.4 mg utilizing the standard escalation regimen duringthe 20-week run-in were typically able to tolerate continued treat-
ment for the remainder of the trial, with only two discontinuations
because of GI AEs after week 20. Furthermore, for those who hadongoing GI side effects, the prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea and
constipation decreased gradually over time.
GI disorders are well-known side effects of GLP-1RAs, leading
clinicians to query whether weight losses are a result of these sideeffects. Across STEP 1-3, we observed that reductions in body weight
from baseline to week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg were nearly as
great in participants without versus with GI AEs: in the descriptiveanalysis, weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg ranged from 9.6% to
17.1% in participants without GI AEs and from 11.4% to 17.7% in
those with GI AEs. Consistent with these observations, the mediationanalysis (which formally estimates the contribution of GI AEs to
weight loss) found that GI AEs appeared to contribute little to the
weight-loss benefit of semaglutide: of the additional 7.6%-14.4%weight loss provided by semaglutide 2.4 mg over placebo in STEP 1-3,
<1 percentage point was estimated to be mediated by GI AEs (for GI
disorders overall and specifically for the occurrence of nausea, diar-rhoea and/or vomiting). Thus, the mediation analysis found thatweight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was mostly attributable to treat-
ment effects unrelated to GI AEs. These results are consistent with
previous analyses of the weight-loss effects of GLP-1RAs in peoplewith obesity and/or T2D, which typically showed a small contribution
of GI AEs to GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.
13,17,18,23,24The ability of102 WHARTON ET AL.
semaglutide to lower body weight appears to relate to increased sati-
ety, appetite regulation, improved hedonic and homeostatic control ofeating and reduced energy intake, mediated by direct and indirect
central nervous system effects, particularly on the hypothalamus and
hindbrain.
25-27
The GI AE profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP trials is
consistent with previous observations with lower semaglutide doses
and the established AE profile of GLP-1RAs.14,28,29Direct comparison
of GI AE incidence with semaglutide 1.0 and 2.4 mg in adults with
T2D and overweight or obesity in STEP 2 found only a slightly higher
incidence of GI AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg (63.5% of participants)versus 1.0 mg (57.5%), despite the more than doubling of dose, andfew patients discontinued treatment because of GI AEs in either
group (4.2% of participants vs. 3.5%, respectively).
9These findings are
consistent with the established dose dependence of GI AEs with theGLP-1RA class and semaglutide specifically.
12,14,30-32As higher inci-
dences of GI AEs tend to be experienced with higher doses of
GLP-1RAs, gradual dose escalation and dose adjustment may helpmitigate the impact of GI AEs in clinical practice.
29,30
Almost all approved obesity pharmacotherapies are commonly
associated with GI AEs, including orlistat (e.g. faecal urgency),phentermine-topiramate (e.g. constipation) and naltrexone-bupropion
(e.g. nausea and constipation).
1,3Use of liraglutide 3.0 mg, another
GLP-1RA, approved for treatment of overweight or obesity, can alsoresult in mild-or-moderate GI AEs of a nature similar to those reportedin the STEP trials, primarily during initial dose escalation.
33-37
The mechanism of action through which GI AEs arise with
GLP-1RAs remains uncertain. Delayed gastric emptying may be a poten-tial contributor, particularly with short-acting GLP-1RAs; longer-acting
agents do not appear to be associated with notable delays in gastric emp-
tying.
14,26,30A 12-week study of semaglutide 1.0 mg in adults with obe-
sity using the paracetamol absorption test identified a delay in first-hour
gastric emptying after a meal versu s placebo; however, a 20-week study
of semaglutide 2.4 mg did not identify such a delay in paracetamol-assessed gastric emptying.
26,38Changes in the rate of lower GI transit
may be responsible for constipation and/or diarrhoea, although evidence
is lacking. The mechanism for GLP-1RA-induced nausea may primarily
relate to central effects; studies in animal models suggest that nausearesponses associated with peripher al GLP-1RA administration involve
activation of GLP-1 receptors in the central nervous system.
39,40
In clinical practice, GI AEs (most commonly nausea) are known to
be a common reason for discontinuation of GLP-1RA treatment.41
People with overweight or obesity must balance the typically short-term impact of potential GI AEs against the significant health benefitsoffered by long-term GLP-1RA treatment. While physicians must
establish a differential diagnosis to exclude other potential causes of
GI symptoms (particularly if symptoms are prolonged/severe),adopting strategies to mitigate the impact of GI AEs and aid resolutionis important to optimize persistence with GLP-1RA treatment. A range
of complementary approaches has been proposed, including: patient
education and counselling on topics such as meal size and stoppingeating when feeling full
29,42; gradual dose escalation7,43-46; and dose
adjustment with re-escalation upon AE resolution.15This study has some limitations. First, the pooled analysis and medi-
ation analyses were post hoc and should, therefore, be considered asexploratory analyses. Second, the time course of GI AEs was not fully
accounted for in the analyses of contribution to weight loss. In addition,
the descriptive analyses of the impact of GI AEs on body weightchanges were only conducted in those who remained on treatment at
week 68, and thus those who discontinued treatment before this time
were excluded. Furthermore, the mediation analysis should be inter-preted with caution, as it assumes no confounding factors beyond those
included in the model (baseline body weight and stratification factors),
which may not be the case, given that post-randomization events(GI AEs) are used in the analysis. For the STEP 4 analyses, while the ran-domization to continued semaglutide or placebo was double-blinded,
participants were aware of this randomized withdrawal trial design,
which could influence AE reporting. Finally, it should be noted that theSTEP trials represent a controlled clinical trial environment with regular
follow-up, which may differ from routine clinical practice.
In conclusion, while GI AEs were common with semaglutide 2.4 mg
across the STEP 1-4 trials, effects were typically mild-to-moderate, non-
serious and transient, with few events leading to treatment discontinua-
tion. The substantial weight-lowering effects of semaglutide 2.4 mgappeared to be largely independent of GI AEs, both for any type of GI
AE and for nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting specifically.
