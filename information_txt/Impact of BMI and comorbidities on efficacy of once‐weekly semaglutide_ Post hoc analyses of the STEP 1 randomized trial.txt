Objective: This study assessed the effects of semaglutide on body weight, cardiome-
tabolic risk factors, and glycemic status in individuals categorized by baseline BMI
with or without additional obesity-related comorbidities, including prediabetes andhigh risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Methods: This was a post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of the Semaglutide
Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1 trial (NCT03548935), in which par-
ticipants without diabetes and BMI ≥30 kg/m
2, or BMI ≥27 kg/m2with ≥1 weight-
related comorbidity, were randomized to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4
mg or placebo for 68 weeks. For this analysis, individuals were categorized into sub-
groups based on baseline BMI <35 versus ≥35 kg/m2(with no additional criteria,
with ≥1 comorbidity, with prediabetes, and with prediabetes and high risk of CVD).
Results: Mean changes in body weight from baseline to week 68 with semaglutide
were/C016.2% and /C014.0% in the subgroups with baseline BMI <35 and ≥35 kg/m2,
respectively (both p< 0.0001 vs. placebo). Similar changes were observed in individ-
uals with comorbidities, with prediabetes, and with prediabetes plus high CVD risk.The beneficial effects of semaglutide on cardiometabolic risk factors were consistent
across all subgroups.
Conclusions: This subgroup analysis confirms that semaglutide is effective in individ-
uals with baseline BMI <35 and ≥35 kg/m
2, including in those with comorbidities.
INTRODUCTION
The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist semaglutide is
approved for weight management on the basis of four clinical trialsthat were part of the global phase 3 Semaglutide Treatment Effect in
People with Obesity (STEP) program [
1–4]. In Europe and the
United States, semaglutide is approved in people with obesity (bodymass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m
2) or those with overweight (BMI ≥27 to
<30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity. This is the
same population for which the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide3.0 mg (Saxenda) is indicated. Approval of liraglutide 3.0 mg was
based, in part, on a 56-week phase 3 clinical trial in people with
BMI ≥30 kg/m2,o rB M I ≥27 kg/m2with dyslipidemia or hyperten-
sion, in which treatment resulted in significantly greater weight losscompared with placebo (8.0% vs. 2.6%) [
5].
However, experience with liraglutide 3.0 mg has shown that, at a
national and/or regional level, cost pressures can result in public reim-bursement authorities recommending its use be restricted to morelimited populations than the approved label. For example, reimburse-
ment of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management is recommendedReceived: 21 October 2022 Revised: 16 December 2022 Accepted: 12 January 2023

only for people with BMI ≥35 kg/m2in Scotland and the Netherlands;
for people with BMI ≥35 kg/m2, prediabetes, and a high risk of cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) in England, Wales, and Finland; or for peoplewith BMI ≥35 kg/m
2and at least one comorbidity in Norway. As a
result, some patients who could benefit from weight management
pharmacotherapy may be denied access to treatment.
It has previously been reported that semaglutide 2.4 mg is effective
across a broad population of patients with overweight or obesity,
including in those who do not meet these reimbursement criteria. Inthe STEP 1 trial of 1961 people with BMI ≥30 kg/m
2(or≥27 with ≥1
weight-related comorbidity) without diabetes, once-weekly subcutane-
ous (s.c.) semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean change in
body weight from baseline to week 68 of /C014.9%, compared with
/C02.4% for placebo [ 1]. A post hoc analysis of STEP 1 revealed substan-
tial weight loss in all subgroups of participants stratified by baseline age
(≤65, 65 to <75, or ≥75 years), race (White, Asian, Black or African
American, or other), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or
Latino, or not reported), and renal function (normal, mild impairment, or
moderate impairment) [ 6, 7]. Weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was
significantly greater in female participants than male (female: 18.4% at
week 68 with semaglutide vs. 2.1% with placebo; male: 12.9%
vs. 3.5%). Substantial weight loss was seen in individuals with normo-glycemia at baseline as well as in those with baseline prediabetes. Whilean interaction was observed between baseline body weight and weight
loss, marked weight loss of at least 13.9% occurred in all body weight
subgroups. Similarly, baseline BMI had no significant effect on weightloss, with all subgroups (including BMI <30) showing weight loss of at
least 15.5% [
6, 7]. This suggests that, if the reimbursement thresholds
commonly applied in Europe for liraglutide were also adopted for sema-glutide 2.4 mg, many patients who could benefit from semaglutide
would be denied access to it. This is particularly concerning given that,
in STEP 1, beneficial effects were also seen with semaglutide versusplacebo on cardiometabolic risk factors, including glycated hemoglobin(HbA
1c), blood pressure, waist circumference, and lipid levels [ 1].
Similar patterns of efficacy, regardless of baseline characteristics,
have been observed in individuals with overweight or obesity andtype 2 diabetes (T2D). In a subgroup analysis of Semaglutide
Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN)-
1 to -5, s.c. semaglutide (0.5 or 1 mg) was associated with greaterreductions in body weight versus comparators, irrespective of base-
line BMI [
8, 9]. Similarly, in a subgroup analysis of Peptide Innovation
for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) 1 to 5, 7, and 8, greaterreductions in HbA
1cand body weight were seen with oral semaglutide
(7 or 14 mg) versus comparators in most subgroups examined, includ-
ing in individuals stratified by baseline BMI [ 10]. Lastly, in a pooled
analysis of four observational Semaglutide Real-world Evidence(SURE) studies of real-world semaglutide use, once-weekly semaglu-
tide was associated with improvements in HbA
1cand body weight in
people with T2D, again irrespective of baseline BMI [ 11]. A pooled
analysis of the cardiovascular outcome trials SUSTAIN-6 and PIO-
NEER 6 revealed beneficial effects of semaglutide versus comparators
on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with T2Dand varying cardiovascular risk [
12–14].Given these reports of beneficial effects of semaglutide in individ-
uals with diverse baseline characteristics, we wished to investigate the
effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg on body weight, glycemic status, andcardiometabolic risk factors in individuals categorized by baseline BMI
and obesity-related comorbidities according to the reimbursement
thresholds commonly used for weight management pharmacotherapy(liraglutide) in Europe. We therefore performed a post hoc subgroupStudy Importance
What is already known?
•Once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide 2.4 mg is
approved for weight management in people with obesity
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI ≥27 to
<30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity.
•However, experience with liraglutide 3.0 mg has shown
that cost pressures can result in public reimbursementauthorities restricting the use of weight management
therapies to more limited populations than the approved
label, e.g., BMI ≥35 kg/m
2, with or without comorbidities.
What does this study add?
•In these post hoc subgroup analyses of the Semaglutide
Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1 trial,
once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg provided effectiveweight loss in individuals with baseline BMI <35 and
≥35 kg/m
2, including in those with ≥1 comorbidity, those
with prediabetes, and those with prediabetes and highrisk of CVD.
•The beneficial effects of semaglutide on cardiometabolic
risk factors (waist circumference, systolic blood pressure,glycated hemoglobin) were consistent across all
subgroups.
How might these results change the direction of
research or the focus of clinical practice?
•By showing that semaglutide 2.4 mg has beneficial
effects in a broad population of individuals with obesity,including those at increased risk of poor outcomes, irre-spective of whether their baseline BMI was <35 or
≥35 kg/m
2, our results suggest that many individuals who
could benefit from semaglutide may be denied access toit based on current European reimbursement thresholds
for weight management therapies.
•Lowering reimbursement thresholds to values consistent
with the evidence base from clinical trials would enable
more individuals with overweight or obesity to benefit
from the improvements in cardiometabolic risk factorsassociated with the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg.EFFICACY OF SEMAGLUTIDE BY BMI AND COMORBIDITIES 991

analysis of the STEP 1 trial to examine the effects of semaglutide in
participants with baseline BMI <35 versus ≥35 kg/m2and in those
with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity (including prediabetes), prediabe-
tes only, or prediabetes and high risk of CVD.
METHODS
Study design
STEP 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial con-
ducted at 129 sites in 16 countries. The full methodology of the
STEP 1 trial has been reported previously [ 1]. Key inclusion criteria
were as follows: age ≥18 years, BMI ≥30 kg/m2(or≥27 kg/m2with
one or more weight-related comorbidities, i.e., hypertension, dyslipi-
demia, obstructive sleep apnea, or CVD), and a history of one or moreself-reported unsuccessful dietary attempts to lose weight. Key exclu-
sion criteria were history of type 1 diabetes or T2D, HbA
1c≥6.5%
(≥48 mmol/mol), previous surgical treatment for obesity, and use of
antiobesity medications within 180 days prior to enrollment.
Participants were randomly assign ed 2:1 to receive once-weekly s.c.
semaglutide 2.4 mg for 68 weeks or matching placebo, in addition to life-style intervention. Semaglutide was initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg onceweekly for the first 4 weeks, with the dose increased every 4 weeks to
reach the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg weekly by week 16. The co-pri-
mary end points in STEP 1 were the percentage change in body weightfrom baseline to week 68 and achievement of a reduction in body weight
of≥5% from baseline to week 68. Confi rmatory secondary end points in
STEP 1 were the achievement of a reduction in body weight of ≥10% and
≥15% by week 68 and changes from base line to week 68 in waist circum-
ference, systolic blood pressure (SBP ), Physical Functioning score on the
36-item Short Form Health Survey v2, and Physical Function score on theImpact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version question-naire. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinic al Practice guidelines. The protocol
was approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional reviewboard at each study site.
Subgroup analyses
The current post hoc subgroup analys es were exploratory and were not
prespecified in the trial protocol . Subgroups were selected based on
populations for whom weight management drug therapy (liraglutide
3.0 mg) is recommended b y public health authorities. Individuals who
were randomized to receive either semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo in theSTEP 1 trial were stratified into two subgroups based on baseline BMI
(<35 vs. ≥35 kg/m
2); these two groups were further categorized into peo-
ple with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity (including prediabetes), those with
prediabetes only, and those with prediabetes and high risk of CVD.
The weight-related comorbidities defined at baseline that were
included were dyslipidemia, hypertens ion, coronary arte ry disease, cere-
brovascular disease, obstructive sl eep apnea, prediabetes, reproductivesystem disorder (menstrual disorder , polycystic ovary syndrome, or invol-
untary impaired fertility/infertility), liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease or nonalcoholic steatohepatit is), kidney disease, osteoarthritis of
the knee or hip, gout or hyperuricemia, and asthma or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Prediabetes was de fined as fasting plasma glucose 5.5
to 6.9 mmol/L or HbA 1c6.0% to 6.4%. A high risk of CVD was defined as
having total cholesterol >5.0 mmol/ L, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol <1.0 mmol/L (men) or <1.3 mmol/L (women), or SBP
>140 mmHg. These definitions are based on those used by the UKNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [
15–17].
Statistical analyses
Two estimands were used to assess treatment efficacy: the treatment
policy estimand (all randomized participants, regardless of prematurediscontinuation of randomized treatment or rescue intervention, i.e.,
antiobesity medication or bariatric surgery) and the trial product estimand
(all randomized participants, assuming they remained on randomizedtreatment for the entire study duration and without rescue intervention).
We anticipate that the treatment policy estimand is of more relevance to
health care decision-makers; therefor e, reported results are for the treat-
ment policy estimand unless otherwise stated. For the treatment policyestimand, continuous efficacy end points were analyzed at weeks 20, 28,
and 68, depending on the end point, using ANCOVA with treatment as
factor and baseline value as covariate. Multiple imputations based on theMcEvoy approach were used for missing data for participants on treat-
ment at a specific visit ( n=6 for semaglutide 2.4 mg and n=3f o rp l a -
cebo for the change in body weight from baseline for the overallpopulation). For participants off treat ment at a specific visit, single impu-
tation was done using linear extrapolation based on off-treatment change
estimates for each treatment arm ( n=88 for semaglutide 2.4 mg and n=
75 for placebo for the change in body weight from baseline for the overallpopulation). For the trial product estim and, all responses prior to first dis-
continuation of treatment (or initiati on of other antiobesity medication or
bariatric surgery) are included in a mixed model for repeated measure-ments with randomized treatment as factor and baseline value as covari-
ate, all nested within visit.
Efficacy data were reported as changes from baseline with sema-
glutide 2.4 mg or placebo in body weight (at weeks 28 and 68), HbA
1c,
SBP, waist circumference, and ratio to baseline for HDL cholesterol
and total cholesterol (all at weeks 20 and 68). For each comparison,estimated treatment differences (estimated treatment ratios for total
and HDL cholesterol) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calcu-
lated. Pvalues were not adjusted for multiplicity because these were
exploratory post hoc analyses for which the original STEP 1 study wasnot powered (see Rothman [
18], Feise [ 19], and Althouse [ 20] for fur-
ther discussion of this issue).
Change in glycemic status over time was determined by compar-
ing the percentage of participants with normoglycemia, prediabetes
(fasting plasma glucose 5.5 –6.9 mmol/L or HbA 1c6.0% –6.4%), and
T2D (fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or HbA 1c≥6.5%) at baseline
and at weeks 20, 52, and 68.992 EFFICACY OF SEMAGLUTIDE BY BMI AND COMORBIDITIES

RESULTS
Participants
Demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized for all par-
ticipants in each subgroup (Table 1) and separately for participants
receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo within each subgroup (Sup-
porting Information Tables S1 –S4). Baseline characteristics were gen-
erally comparable across both treatment arms and subgroups, withthe median age ranging from 45 to 53 years and approximately 70%
of participants being female. Within each subgroup, females were
slightly overrepresented among individuals with BMI ≥35 kg/m
2(vs.
BMI <35). Within each subgroup, participants with BMI ≥35 had
lower median HDL cholesterol than participants with BMI <35; total
cholesterol was also slightly lower among individuals with BMI ≥35.
Effects on body weight
In the overall population in STEP 1, once-weekly s.c. semaglutide
2.4 mg was associated with a mean change in body weight from base-
line to week 68 of /C014.9% compared with /C02.4% for placebo, with
an estimated treatment difference of /C012.4 percentage points (95%CI:/C013.4 to /C011.5; p< 0.001) (Figure 1; trial product estimand
shown in Supporting Information Figure S1) [ 1]. Treatment effects in
the post hoc subgroup analyses are summarized in Figure 1and Sup-
porting Information Figure S1. Mean percentage change in body
weight from baseline to week 68 with once-weekly s.c. semaglutide
2.4 mg was /C016.2% in participants with baseline BMI <35 and
/C014.0% in participants with baseline BMI ≥35 (Figure 1; trial product
estimand shown in Supporting Information Figure S1).
Similar mean percentage changes in body weight from baseline to
week 68 with once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg were observed in
individuals with comorbidities, with prediabetes, and with prediabetes
plus high CVD risk (Figure 1). Within each subgroup, mean percentage
change in body weight was also similar for individuals with baseline
BMI <35 versus ≥35 kg/m2(Figure 1).
Effects on cardiometabolic risk factors
In the overall population in STEP 1, once-weekly s.c. semaglutide
2.4 mg was associated with significantly larger improvements versus
placebo in cardiometabolic risk factors including waist circumference
and SBP [ 1]. Beneficial effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo
were also observed with respect to HbA 1cand fasting lipids [ 1].Semaglutide 2.4 mg

In the post hoc subgroup analyses, the beneficial effects of sema-
glutide on waist circumference, HbA 1c, SBP, and total and HDL choles-
terol were generally consistent across subgroups with comorbidities,with prediabetes, and with prediabetes plus high CVD risk (Figure

trial product estimand shown in Supporting Information Figure S2).
Change in glycemic status
Among participants who were norm oglycemic at baseline, a lower
proportion of those who received semaglutide 2.4 mg progressedto having either prediabetes or T2D at week 68 than among
those who received placebo (Figure 3; trial product estimand
shown in Supporting Information Figure S3). This was true forindividuals with baseline BMI either <35 or ≥35 kg/m
2, including
for those with comorbidities. Among participants with prediabe-
tes at baseline, a higher proporti on achieved normoglycemia with
semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo, irrespective of their base-
line BMI (Figure 3).
The same pattern was seen among participants with prediabe-

DISCUSSION
In the STEP 1 trial, once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg was associ-
ated with clinically meaningful weight loss versus placebo in peoplewith obesity or in those with overweight and at least one weight-
related comorbidity. Semaglutide 2.4 mg also had beneficial effects on
multiple cardiometabolic risk factors. A previous subgroup analysis ofSTEP 1 found that the beneficial effects of semaglutide on weight losscompared with placebo were generally consistent across subgroups
defined by baseline age, sex, race, ethnicity, body weight, BMI, renal
function, and glycemic status [
6]. Here, we show that the beneficial
effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg on weight loss, glycemic status, and car-diometabolic risk factors are consistent across subgroups based on
baseline BMI and the presence of comorbidities. Across all subgroups,
the effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo were consistentbetween those with baseline BMI <35 kg/m

BMI≥35 kg/m2, including in those with comorbidities, prediabetes, or
prediabetes and high CVD risk. This included the observation that
more participants with prediabetes at baseline were normoglycemic atweek 68 with semaglutide versus placebo, consistent with analysis
across the STEP 1, 3, and 4 trials that reported significant improve-
ments in glucose metabolism and a greater likelihood of achieving nor-moglycemia with semaglutide [
21]. Thus, semaglutide 2.4 mg is
effective in people with obesity with a BMI that may be below the
threshold for reimbursement as well as in those with BMI ≥35, includ-
ing those with comorbidities.
The costs of complications related to overweight and obesity are
increasing worldwide. In 2019, the economic impact of overweight
and obesity was already equivalent to 2.19% of global gross domesticproduct [
22], and by 2025, annual health care costs for obesity-
related complications are expected to reach approximately $1.2 tril-
lion [ 23]. Reducing the increase in overweight and obesity prevalence
by 5% compared with current projected trends could save more
$420 billion annually [ 22].
In a study comparing the cost-effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor
agonists for the treatment of obesity, semaglutide was found to be
more cost-effective than liraglutide, dulaglutide, and exenatide in a US
setting [ 24]. Semaglutide was also judged to be more effective than
five other pharmacotherapies for weight management in people withBMI of 30 to <35 kg/m
2over 3- and 5-year horizons, although it was
not considered to be cost-effective [ 25]. Over a 30-year span in the
United States, semaglutide 2.4 mg was deemed cost-effective for thetreatment of obesity in individuals with BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 kg/m
2
plus≥1 weight-related comorbidity, compared with diet and exercise
alone and compared with other weight management medications [ 26].
Cost-effectiveness was also demonstrated in a Canadian study [ 27].
Studies in multiple countries have also variously found oral or
s.c. formulations of semaglutide to be cost-effective compared withmedications such as insulin, empagliflozin, liraglutide, and dulaglutidefor the treatment of T2D [
28–34].
Although BMI has long been the standard means of diagnosing
and categorizing overweight and obesity, the limitations of the mea-sure are increasingly being recognized (e.g., Nuttall [
35]). Targeting
markers of cardiometabolic risk can be clinically worthwhile, especially
because these markers may be more strongly associated with mortal-ity risk than obesity, per se [
36]. As a class, GLP-1 receptor agonists
reduce body weight, improve glycemia, and may have additional
cardioprotective effects [ 37]. In exploratory post hoc analyses of
STEP 1, 2, and 3, semaglutide 2.4 and 1.0 mg reduced levels of the
inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein, compared with placebo, in
individuals with overweight or obesity, with or without T2D, irrespec-tive of baseline BMI, body weight, or glycemic status [
38]. Several
GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown reductions in the risk of MACE
in populations with T2D [ 39–41]. In two cardiovascular outcome trials
in patients with T2D and high CVD risk, semaglutide, administered bys.c. injection or orally, was associated with a lower incidence of MACE
compared with placebo (SUSTAIN-6: hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% CI:
0.58 to 0.95], p=0.016; PIONEER 6: HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.57 to 1.11],
p=0.017) [
12, 13 ]; however, the patient population and doses/formulations of semaglutide in SUSTAIN-6 and PIONEER 6 were dif-
ferent from those in STEP 1. In exploratory analyses of STEP 1 and 4,
semaglutide 2.4 mg improved cardiometabolic risk factors (includingwaist circumference, SBP, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insu-
lin, and lipids) versus placebo in individuals with overweight or obesity
without T2D [
42]. The ongoing Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease
and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) cardio-
vascular outcome trial is examining whether once-weekly s.c. sema-
glutide 2.4 mg added to standard of care is superior to placebo forpreventing MACE in a cohort of patients with overweight or obesity,without T2D, and established CVD [
37].
In both the overall population and in the current subgroup ana-
lyses of STEP 1, the effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg on cholesterollevels (total and HDL) were smaller than those seen with the other
cardiometabolic markers of waist circumference, SBP, and HbA
1c, sug-
gesting that GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce CVD risk via analternative mechanism to lipid-lowering therapies. Reduction in CVD
risk may involve both indirect mechanisms via modification of risk fac-
tors, as well as direct effects via GLP-1 receptors in the cardiovascularsystem.
A strength of the current analyses is that they examined the
effects of semaglutide on multiple cardiometabolic risk factors in addi-tion to changes in body weight and glycemic status. However, theanalyses were post hoc and were not specified in the STEP 1 protocol.
Moreover, the stratification of participants into subgroups inevitably
reduced the size of each group, and the subgroups were not mutuallyexclusive. Nevertheless, the smallest subgroup still contained >150
individuals. Another possible limitation is that participants were not
analyzed by race or ethnicity. Although a lower BMI threshold than30 kg/m
2to indicate high risk (typically 27.5 kg/m2) has been recom-
mended for people of South Asian, Chinese, and Black African or
Caribbean race and ethnicity, numbers of participants from thesegroups in this trial were insufficient for meaningful stratification intosubgroups by baseline BMI with or without obesity-related
comorbidities.
CONCLUSION
In summary, many studies of obesity have classified participants solelyon the basis of their BMI. However, there has been increasing recog-
nition that targeting cardiometabolic status may also be key to reduc-ing obesity-related morbidity and mortality. These subgroup analyses
of the STEP 1 trial confirm that once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg
is efficacious in individuals at increased risk of poor outcomes, specifi-cally in those with comorbidities, with prediabetes, or with prediabe-tes plus high CVD risk. Importantly, these benefits are seen
irrespective of whether baseline BMI is <35 or ≥35 kg/m
2. Once-
weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg can thus reduce body weight andimprove cardiometabolic health and glycemic status across a broad
population of individuals with obesity, including in those who may be
denied access to treatment on the basis of current reimbursementthresholds.
