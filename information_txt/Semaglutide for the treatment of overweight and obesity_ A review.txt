Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a
substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments
for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves
only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment
Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) in
people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg
was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%-17.4% in individuals with over-
weight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%-79% of
participants achieved ≥10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%-27% with
placebo) and 51%-64% achieved ≥15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo). In
STEP 5, mean weight loss was /C015.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus /C02.6% with
placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obe-
sity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was /C09.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg ver-
sus/C03.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic
risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical
function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile ofsemaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse
events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential
for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases.

1|INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a highly prevalent, chronic, relapsing disease requiring
long-term management.1-3The clinical complications of obesity affect
almost every organ system, and the impact of obesity on morbidity,
mortality and health care costs is substantial.4-7The prevalence ofobesity has risen globally for the past several decades, a trend pre-
dicted to continue.8,9Worldwide obesity prevalence is 13%,10but
many countries have a much higher prevalence; for example, preva-lence in adults increased from 31% to 42% between 1999-2000 and2017-2018 in the USA,
11with an increase from 10% to 40% across
most European countries over a 10-year period to 2017.8Received: 31 May 2022 Revised: 1 September 2022 Accepted: 4 September 2022

Lifestyle modification is the guideline-recommended foundation
of treatment for individuals with overweight or obesity,7,12-14but typ-
ically achieves only modest weight loss that is often regained.15-17
Furthermore, this loss is challenging to maintain because of metabolicadaptation that promotes gradual weight regain.
13,17Pharmacological
treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle interven-
tions, but until recently the available agents only offered moderate
weight loss over that achieved with lifestyle intervention.18Semaglu-
tide is a potent long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue
that requires once-weekly administration.19The Semaglutide Treat-
ment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial developmentprogramme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide2.4 mg in people with overweight or obesity. Based on data from the
STEP trials, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg has been
approved in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA for chronic weightmanagement in adults with overweight (with weight-related comor-
bidities) or obesity.
20-23
The aim of this review is to describe the study designs and clinical
outcomes of the published trials from the STEP programme, discuss
clinical implications of the data and practicalities of using semaglutide
2.4 mg in individuals with obesity and place the STEP programme intothe context of the current and future obesity pharmacotherapy
landscapes.
2|PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF OBESITY
Obesity is associated with alterations in the quantity, distribution and
function of adipose tissue. Most cases result from complex interac-
tions between genetic, metabolic, neuroendocrine, behavioural and
environmental factors involved in the regulation of energy balanceand fat storage.
24,25In addition to these complex interactions, the
imbalance in activity level and energy intake ultimately resulting in
increased fat storage may be impacted by individual epigenetics andthe gut microbiome.
26
3|MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY
Older pharmacological options for chronic weight management, such
as orlistat, phentermine-topiramate and naltrexone-bupropion, typi-cally show moderate efficacy ( /C243%-9% mean weight loss over that
achieved with lifestyle intervention alone).
18,27-31Liraglutide 3.0 mg
once daily administered subcutaneously was the first GLP-1 receptoragonist (GLP-1RA) to be approved for weight management, after dem-
onstrating weight losses of 4%-6% over those achieved with lifestyle
intervention alone in clinical trials of 20-56 weeks' duration. In thesetrials, 46%-76% of participants lost ≥5% and 23%-37% lost ≥10% of
their baseline body weight.
18,32-35
Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue shown to reduce energy intake,
reduce hunger and increase feeli ngs of satiety and fullness.19,36This
effect has been shown to arise via GLP-1 receptor activation in the cen-
tral nervous system, with further indirect modulation of neuronal activity
involved in appetite regulation and food intake and preference.37TheSTEP programme was designed to comp rehensively explore the efficacy
of once-weekly subcutaneous semagl utide 2.4 mg in people with over-
weight or obesity, with each trial addr essing a specific research question.
For the six completed trials discuss ed in this review, these are: STEP
1 (large pivotal study), weight loss38;S T E P2 ,w e i g h tl o s si nt y p e2d i a b e -

glutide.43In addition to these STEP trials, a regional phase IIIa trial, STEP
6, assessed the effect of semaglutide versus placebo for weight manage-ment in 401 adults from east Asia (Jap an and South Korea) with obesity,
with or without type 2 diabetes.

4|STEP TRIAL DESIGNS
Table 1compares key aspects of the trial designs, eligibility criteria, par-
ticipant demographics and baseline c haracteristics of the global trials.
In STEP 1, the largest trial (N =1961),38participants were random-
ized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg ormatching placebo for 68 weeks. At week 68, treatments (including life-
style intervention) were discontinued and an off-treatment extension
followed a representative subset of participants for a further year.
STEP 2
39enrolled individuals with type 2 diabetes [glycated hae-
moglobin (HbA1c) 7.0%-10.0%], and randomized them to once-
weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg (the
approved dose in type 2 diabetes) or placebo for 68 weeks.
STEP 340was a 68-week trial that compared once-weekly subcu-
taneous semaglutide 2.4 mg with placebo as an adjunct to intensive
behavioural therapy and an initial low-calorie meal-replacement dietfor all participants.
STEP 4
41was a 68-week withdrawal trial, designed to assess the
effect on weight change of continuing versus discontinuing once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg after an initial 20-weeksemaglutide run-in period.
STEP 5
42is the longest trial of the STEP programme. Participants
were randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide2.4 mg or matching placebo for 104 weeks.
STEP 6
44was a 68-week trial in adults from east Asia with a body
mass index (BMI) of ≥27.0 kg/m2with ≥2 weight-related comorbid-
ities or a BMI of ≥35.0 kg/m2with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity
(one comorbidity had to be either hypertension, dyslipidaemia or, in
Japan only, type 2 diabetes). Participants were randomized to sema-glutide 2.4 mg, 1.7 mg or placebo.
STEP 8
43was a head-to-head comparison in which participants
were randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide2.4 mg or matching placebo, or once-daily liraglutide 3.0 mg or match-ing placebo for 68 weeks.
All trials followed the same dose-escalation regimen. Participants
treated with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg were initiated on adose of 0.25 mg once weekly and the dose was escalated every
4 weeks to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg, until the target dose of 2.4 mg
was reached at week 16. If participants were unable to tolerate theBERGMANN ET AL. 19

2.4 mg dose because of adverse events (AEs), lower maintenance
doses were permitted if the participant would otherwise discontinuetrial treatment completely. It was recommended that participants
made at least one attempt to re-escalate to the recommended target
dose.
38-44Diet and physical activity (lifestyle intervention) were
recorded daily in a diary or by use of a smartphone application or
other tools, reviewed during counselling sessions.
4.1 |Estimands used to assess treatment efficacy
In line with regulatory guidance, the STEP trials were designed to
report results using two estimands.45The treatment policy (primary)
estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or
rescue medication, while the secondary trial product estimand mod-elled treatment effects in all randomly assigned participants, assuming
they had remained on treatment for the duration of the trials, and
without initiation of rescue medication. The data reported in thisreview are based on the primary treatment policy estimand, since the
statistical analyses were performed using this approach. Results using
the two estimands were largely consistent.
5|CLINICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE STEP
PROGRAMME
5.1 |Demographics and baseline characteristics
STEP 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8 showed broadly similar participant demographics
and baseline characteristics (Table 1).38,40-43In contrast, STEP 2 had a
lower proportion of female participants (51% vs. 74%-81% in theother trials), a greater mean age (55 years vs. 46-49 years) and a
higher mean HbA1c (8.1% vs. 5.5%-5.7%), which is to be expected for
a trial enrolling individuals with type 2 diabetes.
39Mean BMI was
lower in STEP 2 than the other trials (35.7 kg/m2vs. 37.5-38.4 kg/
m2).38-43The STEP 6 trial population comprised mainly Japanese par-
ticipants (90%) with the remainder from South Korea. Mean body
weight and BMI was lower for this population than in other STEP tri-als (87.5 kg and 31.9 kg/m
2, respectively).44
5.2 |Efficacy outcomes
Table 2presents results of the primary and selected key secondary
and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary
endpoints. Across the 68-week long trials in individuals with over-
weight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP1, 3, 4 and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weightloss of 14.9%-17.4% from baseline to week 68 (Table
2).38,40,41,43Fur-
thermore, >84% of participants were receiving the full dose of sema-
glutide at week 68.
In STEP 1, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle
intervention was 14.9% (vs. 2.4% with placebo), whereas in STEP
3, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behaviouraltherapy was 16.0% (vs. 5.7% with placebo).38,40In STEP 4, the mean
decrease in body weight during the 20-week run-in period with sema-glutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue
semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to
68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean6.9% increase.
41In STEP 8, mean weight loss was greater with sema-
glutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week
68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).43
In the STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials (the 68-week long trials in par-
ticipants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥5% (a threshold widely
accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy)46
was achieved by 86%-89% of participants receiving semaglutide2.4 mg versus 29%-48% receiving placebo (Table
2).38,40,41,43In
these trials, 69%-79% of participants achieved ≥10% weight loss
with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12% -27% with placebo), 51%-64%
achieved ≥15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo), and 32%-
40% achieved ≥20% weight loss (vs. 2%-5% with placebo)
(Table 2).38,40,41,43
Among participants with type 2 diabetes in the STEP 2 trial, the
reduction in body weight with semaglutide 2.4 mg was 9.6% (vs. 7.0%
for semaglutide 1.0 mg and 3.4% for placebo) from baseline to week68 (Table
2). In STEP 2, 69% of participants achieved ≥5% weight loss
with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 57% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 29%
with placebo). In addition, participants were more likely to probablylose ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% body weight with semaglutide 2.4 mg
versus placebo (46% vs. 8%, 26% vs. 3% and 13 vs. 2%, respectively)
(Table
2).39
In STEP 5, mean weight loss from baseline to week 104 was
15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 2.6% with placebo. Participants
were more likely to probably lose ≥5%,≥10% and ≥15% and ≥20%
body weight with semaglutide versus placebo (77% vs. 34%, 62%vs. 13%, 52% vs. 7.0% and 36% vs. 2%, respectively).
42
In STEP 6 (east Asian population with or without diabetes), mean
weight loss from baseline to week 68 was 13.2% with semaglutide2.4 mg, 9.6% with semaglutide 1.7 mg and 2.1% with placebo. As inthe other STEP trials, a larger proportion of participants achieved
≥5%,≥10% and ≥15% reduction in baseline bodyweight with sema-
glutide 2.4 mg compared with placebo (83% vs. 21%, 61% vs. 5% and41% vs. 3%, respectively).
44
Secondary endpoint results from the STEP trials indicated
improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors including waist circumfer-ence, blood pressure, lipids and C-reactive protein with semaglutide
2.4 mg, as well as benefits on physical function and quality of life from
baseline to week 68 (Table
2).38-43Improvements in body composition
with semaglutide 2.4 mg were observed in a subpopulation of partici-
pants assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in STEP 1,38and
with reductions in visceral fat areas with semaglutide 2.4 mg observedin a subpopulation of participants assessed by computed tomographyscan in STEP 6.
44Changes in glycaemic status (shift from prediabetes
to normoglycaemia; tested while on treatment) were observed in
STEP 1 and STEP 6. Further analyses of participants with baseline pre-diabetes from the STEP 1, 3 and 4 trials showed that treatment with
semaglutide resulted in significantly more participants with normogly-
caemia at week 68.

In STEP 2, mean reduction in HbA 1cfrom baseline to week 68 with
semaglutide 2.4 mg was 1.6%, versus 1.5% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and
0.4% with placebo. More patients rece iving semaglutide decreased use of
concomitant glucose-lowering medic ations. Furthermore, urine albumin-
to-creatinine ratios were improved with semaglutide in STEP 2.39
5.3 |Safety
The safety profile of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg
was broadly consistent across the STEP trials. AEs, serious AEs, AEsleading to discontinuation, AEs reported in ≥10% of participants in
any trial and safety focus area AEs are detailed in Table
3.38-43
AEs reported for semaglutide 2.4 mg were typical of the GLP-1RA
class in general and were primarily ga strointestinal (GI) events. Most
events were transient, and mild or moderate in severity. No new safety
concerns arose from the STEP trials. The occurrence of cholelithiasis was
consistent with the known associations between rapid weight loss andincreased risk of cholelithiasis, and with previous reports of gallbladder-
related disorders with GLP-1RAs.
48-50There were no notable increases in
the incidence of acute pancreatitis w ith semaglutide 2.4 mg. In the STEP
2 trial, participants were excluded if they had uncontrolled and potentially
unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy. In terms of AEs, diabetic
retinopathy events were reported in 4 .0% of patients receiving semaglu-
tide 2.4 mg, 2.7% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.7% with placebo.39
GI AEs generally led to more participants discontinuing treatment
in the semaglutide 2.4 mg groups compared with placebo groups
(0.8%-4.5% vs. 0%-1.2%, respectively), but overall, few participantsdiscontinued treatment for this reason (Table
3).38-43No new safety
signals were observed with longer-term semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment
in STEP 5.42In STEP 8, rates of AEs (which were mostly GI-related)
were similar with semaglutide 2.4 mg and liraglutide 3.0 mg (95.2%
vs. 96.1%). Of note, rates of discontinuation due to of AEs were lower
with semaglutide than with liraglutide (3.2% vs. 12.6%).43
STEP 2 was the only trial to include a once-weekly semaglutide
1.0 mg treatment arm in addition to the placebo arm. A slightly higher
proportion of participants experienced GI AEs in the semaglutide
2.4 mg group versus the semaglutide 1.0 mg group (63.5% vs. 57.5%,respectively, and vs. 34.3% in the placebo group).
39In the STEP 6 trial,
which included once-weekly semaglutide 1.7 mg, GI AEs were
reported in fewer participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group com-pared with the 1.7 mg group (59% and 64%, respectively).

100-107 kg,38,40,41,43offering the potential for clinically relevant
improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases. Weightloss with behavioural interventions often plateaus at a level of 5%-
10% and is associated with a high risk of relapse, which may be
related to metabolic adaptation.
17,51Although weight loss of 5%-10%
is linked to improvements in cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, glycae-
mia and quality of life, reductions in body weight beyond 10% provide
further improvement in these outcomes and are associated withremission of type 2 diabetes and reductions in CV events.
52-55As
such, weight loss of ≥10%-15% is recommended in people with com-
plications of overweight and obesity, such as gastroesophageal refluxdisease, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea, non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis and diabetes.
7,56As obesity is a chronic and relapsing dis-
ease, weight regain after initial loss is common. With lifestyle
intervention alone, the initial weight lost is typically regained gradu-ally, even when the intervention continues.
57-59This is reflected in
the STEP 4 results, where the mean weight change after 48 weeks
among participants who switched from semaglutide 2.4 mg to placebowas+6.9%, even though lifestyle intervention was continued
(vs./C07.9% among those who continued semaglutide plus lifestyle
intervention).
41
Semaglutide 2.4 mg for 2 years resulted in substantial and sus-
tained changes in body weight versus placebo in STEP 5 ( /C015.2%
vs./C02.6%),42demonstrating encouraging long-term maintenance of
weight loss.
The mean weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes in STEP
2 was less than that observed in STEP 1 (which employed a similar
study design but with a population of adults with obesity, and withouttype 2 diabetes).
38,39It is well known that weight reductions in people
with type 2 diabetes are often less than in people without diabetes,60
although the full reasons for this remain unknown. In STEP 2, semaglu-
tide 2.4 mg provided only a small numerical improvement over 1.0 mg
in glycaemic parameters (HbA 1clevels and targets, fasting plasma glu-
cose, and reduction in use of concomitant oral glucose-lowering medi-ations). However, the benefit of the higher dose is seen in the contextof greater weight loss.
39
STEP 3 assessed the impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination
with intensive behavioural therapy and an initial low-calorie meal-replacement diet, reporting mean weight loss of 16.0% (vs. 5.7% in
the placebo group).
40However, in the other STEP trials, a less inten-
sive lifestyle intervention programme was used, and similar levels ofweight loss were achieved, suggesting that an intensive approach may
not contribute significant additional weight loss. Rather, the results
show the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in those with over-weight or obesity, probably through its ability to control appetite,
energy intake and food cravings.
The STEP 6 results indicate that semaglutide 2.4 mg is an effec-
tive weight management option also in people from east Asia withobesity, and further illustrates a semaglutide-induced reduction in vis-
ceral fat, which are known to be a strong predictor of weight-related
comorbidities, particularly in people from east Asia.
44
STEP 8 is the first direct comparison of semaglutide with another
weight-management medication in a randomized trial. Semaglutide2.4 mg demonstrated better efficacy than liraglutide as well as offer-
ing more convenient once-weekly rather than once-daily injections.43
Although direct comparisons with other treatments cannot be made
because of methodological differences between trials, overall the
weight loss with other approved medications appears to be moremodest than that seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP tri-
als.
18,27-31
The STEP trials showed both short- and longer-term improve-
ments in cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with overweight
or obesity. Earlier data from PIONEER 6 and SUSTAIN 6 suggested a
CV benefit of semaglutide at lower doses in individuals with type2 diabetes.
61Together, these findings indicate a potential role for
semaglutide in the management of cardiometabolic risk factors. The
ongoing SELECT trial (NCT03574597) will report on CV outcomes
with semaglutide 2.4 mg in a population without diabetes who are athigh CV risk.
62
The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for
the GLP-1RA class and was similar to that seen in other trials of sub-cutaneous semaglutide in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
63In clini-
cal practice, the extensive experience with this molecule at the
1.0 mg dose in type 2 diabetes and with the GLP-1RA class overallshould ensure a certain degree of confidence in the safety profile.
This includes the rate of severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypo-
glycaemia, which in STEP 2 was rep orted in similar proportions of
subjects receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1.0 mg (5.7% and 5.5%,respectively).
39
The encouraging data from validated patient-reported outcomes
(Short Form-36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version in STEP 1-4and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version
questionnaire in STEP 1 and 2) point towards the benefits of semaglu-
tide 2.4 mg being directly perceived by study participants.
6.2 |Key clinical considerations for using
once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg inclinical practice
Currently, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved
for use in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA as an adjunct to a
reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight
management in adults with an initial BMI of ≥30 or ≥27 kg/m2in the
presence of ≥1 weight-related comorbid condition.20-23
Figure 1illustrates key considerations for the use of once-weekly sub-
cutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice. Semaglutide should beinitiated at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and then escalated every
4 weeks according to the dose-es calation schedule in Figure
1, until the
maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached.20,21This escalation
schedule is designed to minimize GI AEs , but if a patient does not tolerate
a dose during the escalation period, t he subsequent escalation step can be
delayed for a further 4 weeks, after which it should be re-escalated to
2.4 mg. If needed, this re-escalation step can be postponed (e.g. for 4 moreweeks) and the escalation can be sto pped at a lower maintenance dose

should be monitored prior to starting and during treatment with semaglu-
tide 2.4 mg.20
The STEP trials excluded participants with renal impairment (esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate <15 ml/min/1.73 m2; except STEP
2, <30 ml/min/1.73 m2or <60 ml/min/1.73 m2with SGLT2i).38-44
However, the prescribing information states that no dose adjustment
of semaglutide is recommended for patients with renal impairment.20
There is limited evidence from trials and real-world studies on
strategies for managing GI side effects of GLP-1RA treatment. Expert
recommendations based on clinical experience centre around educa-
tion and explanation, escalation to an appropriate dose and effectivemanagement.
64Patients should be counselled about the possibility of
GI side effects and advised that they are typically transient and mild-
to-moderate in severity. For mild and short-term GI side effects, this
should include providing advice on dietary modifications and recom-mending that patients increase their fibre and water intake for consti-
pation and consider stool softeners. For more persistent or severe GI
symptoms, pausing of dose escalation is recommended, and short-term use of over-the-counter medications may be considered.
The lack of clinical trial data on switching between liraglutide
3.0 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obe-sity precludes the development of formal evidence-based recommen-
dations. However, in the context of the use of GLP-1RAs in patients
with type 2 diabetes, recommendations include patient counselling,starting with the recommended dose titration (considering history ofGI events with the previous GLP-1RA), management of GI side effects
and re-evaluation of response.
65,66
Semaglutide 2.4 mg has shown clinically meaningful bodyweight
reductions in obesity both in the primarily white population of the
STEP 1-5 and 8 trials, as well as in the east Asian participants of the
STEP 6 trial. Furthermore, post hoc analyses from STEP 2 indicatethat the response to semaglutide 2.4 mg was not influenced by race
or ethnicity.
67However, a regional Phase IIIa trial in Brazil, China,
Hong Kong and South Korea is ongoing and will further add to ourknowledge on ethnicity as a potential clinical consideration.
Semaglutide regulates blood glucose via the incretin pathway,
stimulating insulin and inhibiting glucagon secretion in a glucose-
dependent manner, leading to lower blood glucose levels with lowrisk for hypoglycaemia.
68In STEP 2, insulin treatment was only
allowed for rescue therapy and those taking sulphonylureas were to
reduce the dose by 50% to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Severeor blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemia was reported in 5.7%
versus 3.0% of participants treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus
placebo.
39In the SUSTAIN trials in patients with type 2 diabetes,
severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemia occurred among
participants in the semaglutide groups at a similar or lower level than
in comparator groups.63Clinicians may wish to consider reducing
t h ed o s eo fi n s u l i ns e c r e t a g o g u e or insulin to reduce the risk of
hypoglycaemia.20,21
Semaglutide causes delay of gastric emptying and therefore has
the potential to affect absorption of oral medications.20,21While
absorption was not affected in clinical pharmacology trials of semaglu-
tide 1.0 mg, monitoring is advised.20,217|FUTURE LANDSCAPE OF OBESITY
PHARMACOTHERAPY
In addition to the published STEP trials, the programme includes
three further ongoing global phase IIIa studies in adolescents with
obesity (STEP TEENS),69in individuals with heart failure and obesity
(STEP-HFpEF)70a n di ni n d i v i d u a l sw i t hh e a r tf a i l u r ea n do b e s i t y
with type 2 diabetes (STEP-HFpEF-DM)71(Figure 2). In addition, as
previously mentioned, a regional phase IIIa trial is ongoing in Brazil,
China, Hong Kong and South Korea (STEP 7).72Phase IIIb trials in
the programme are investigating weight management in knee osteo-arthritis (STEP 9)
73and reversal of prediabetes to normoglycaemia
(STEP 10).74
Beyond the STEP programme, the SELECT trial is an ongoing
event-driven placebo-controlled CV outcomes trial of semaglutide2.4 mg once daily in people with overweight or obesity without diabe-
tes and with established CV disease.
62SELECT is the first CV trial to
evaluate superiority in reduction of major adverse CV events for anobesity pharmacotherapy in this population.
Taken together, the results from the STEP clinical trial programme
show semaglutide 2.4 mg to be the most effective drug currentlyapproved for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity. Among
new molecules on the horizon for the treatment of overweight and
obesity, the most promising appears to be tirzepatide (LY3298176),an incretin mimetic with a dual action targeting both the GLP-1 recep-tor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) recep-
tor
75-85(Figure 2and Supplementary Figure 1). Tirzepatide has shown
promising results on obesity with a side effect profile close to sema-glutide. A second GLP-1/GIP receptor dual agonist, NNC0090-2746,
is at an earlier stage of development.
86Other potential future obesity
treatments include the GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptor triple agonist,NNC9204-1706
87; the dual GLP-1 receptor/glucagon receptor ago-
nists, BI 456906 and SAR42589988,89; the glucagon analogue,
HM1513690; the amylin analogues, ZP839691and cagrilintide in com-
bination with semaglutide92; the Y2R agonist, NNC0165-1875 in
combination with semaglutide93; and the melanocortin 4 receptor
agonist, setmelanotide94,95(Figure 2).
8|CONCLUSIONS
A growing body of data from the STEP clinical trial programme has
demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of once-weekly subcutane-
ous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obesity.Across the STEP trials, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide
2.4 mg was consistently associated with mean weight losses of
14.9%-17.4% in participants without diabetes, and improvements incardiometabolic risk factors, physical function and quality of life. Fur-thermore, the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected
for the GLP-1RA class. Results of other trials within the STEP pro-
gramme are awaited, together with data from SELECT, which will pro-vide valuable information on the impact of weight reduction with
semaglutide 2.4 mg on decreasing CV risk.BERGMANN ET AL. 31
