Obesity is a chronic disease that results in substantial global morbidity and mor -
tality. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulino -
tropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in people with 
obesity are not known.
METHODS
In this phase 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 2539 
adults with a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square 
of the height in meters) of 30 or more, or 27 or more and at least one weight-re -
lated complication, excluding diabetes, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly, 
subcutaneous tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks, includ -
ing a 20-week dose-escalation period. Coprimary end points were the percentage 
change in weight from baseline and a weight reduction of 5% or more. The 
treatment-regimen estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinua -
tion in the intention-to-treat population.
RESULTS
At baseline, the mean body weight was 104.8 kg, the mean BMI was 38.0, and 
94.5% of participants had a BMI of 30 or higher. The mean percentage change in 
weight at week 72 was −15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], −15.9 to −14.2) with 
5-mg weekly doses of tirzepatide, −19.5% (95% CI, −20.4 to −18.5) with 10-mg 
doses, and −20.9% (95% CI, −21.8 to −19.9) with 15-mg doses and −3.1% (95% CI, 
−4.3 to −1.9) with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). The per -
centage of participants who had weight reduction of 5% or more was 85% (95% 
CI, 82 to 89), 89% (95% CI, 86 to 92), and 91% (95% CI, 88 to 94) with 5 mg, 10 mg, 
and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and 35% (95% CI, 30 to 39) with placebo; 
50% (95% CI, 46 to 54) and 57% (95% CI, 53 to 61) of participants in the 10-mg 
and 15-mg groups had a reduction in body weight of 20% or more, as compared 
with 3% (95% CI, 1 to 5) in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons with 
placebo). Improvements in all prespecified cardiometabolic measures were ob -
served with tirzepatide. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were 
gastrointestinal, and most were mild to moderate in severity, occurring primarily 
during dose escalation. Adverse events caused treatment discontinuation in 4.3%, 
7.1%, 6.2%, and 2.6% of participants receiving 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepa -
tide doses and placebo, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
In this 72-week trial in participants with obesity, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of tirzepa -
tide once weekly provided substantial and sustained reductions in body weight.

Obesity is the most prevalent 
chronic disease worldwide, affecting ap -
proximately 650 million adults.1 Excess 
adiposity and its numerous complications, in -
cluding cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabe -
tes, impose a considerable economic burden and 
constitute major contributors to global morbid -
ity and mortality.2-4 Treatments that result in 
substantial weight reductions may improve out -
comes for people living with obesity.
Historically, the treatment of obesity focused 
almost exclusively on lifestyle-based approaches. 
However, evidence that diet and exercise prompt 
physiological counterregulatory mechanisms that 
limit weight reduction and impede weight main -
tenance has led to the realization that obesity is 
a complex, multicomponent metabolic disease of 
energy homeostasis involving central and pe -
ripheral mechanisms.5 Once obesity is present, 
those mechanisms render a return to lower 
weight difficult.6 Accordingly, several clinical 
guidelines now recommend treatment with anti -
obesity medications for people with obesity or 
for those with overweight and weight-related 
complications.7,8 Recent studies with long-acting 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor ago -
nists demonstrated that greater efficacy with 
acceptable safety could be achieved by targeting 
the pathways of endogenous nutrient-stimulated 
hormones.9,10 Glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
polypeptide (GIP), another nutrient-stimulated 
hormone, regulates energy balance through cell-
surface receptor signaling in the brain and adi -
pose tissue.11 A molecule that combines both 
GIP and GLP receptor agonism theoretically may 
lead to greater efficacy in weight reduction.
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly subcutaneous 
injectable peptide (approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration [FDA] for type 2 diabetes) 
engineered from the native GIP sequence, with 
agonist activity at both the GIP and GLP-1 recep -
tors.12 Preclinical data demonstrated that the 
affinity of tirzepatide for GIP receptors was 
equal to the affinity of native GIP for GIP recep -
tors, whereas tirzepatide bound GLP-1 receptors 
with affinity approximately five times weaker 
than native GLP-1 bound GLP-1 receptors.12 GIP 
activation appeared to act synergistically with 
GLP-1 receptor activation to allow greater weight 
reduction in mice than that achieved with GLP-1 
receptor monoagonism.12 In phase 2 studies in people with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide induced 
clinically relevant weight reduction, warranting 
further investigation for the treatment of obesity. 
The present trial, SURMOUNT-1, evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with 
obesity or overweight who did not have diabetes.
Methods
Trial Design
This phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, random -
ized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 
119 sites in nine countries (Fig. S1 in the Supple -
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org). The protocol is avail -
able at NEJM.org. The trial was conducted in 
accordance with the principles of the Declaration 
of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guide -
lines and was approved by an independent ethics 
committee or institutional review board at each 
trial site. All the participants provided written, 
informed consent before participation. The spon -
sor (Eli Lilly) designed and oversaw the conduct 
of the trial; trial site investigators were responsi -
ble for data collection, and the sponsor undertook 
site monitoring, data collation, and data analy -
sis. All the authors participated in interpretation 
of the data and in critical review of the manu -
script. The investigators worked under confiden -
tiality agreements with the sponsor; all the au -
thors had full access to the trial data and vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Participants
Adults who were 18 years of age or older, with a 
body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters) of 
30 or more, or a BMI of 27 or more and at least 
one weight-related complication (e.g., hyperten -
sion, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, or 
cardiovascular disease), and who reported one or 
more unsuccessful dietary effort to lose weight 
were eligible to participate. Key exclusion criteria 
were diabetes, a change in body weight of more 
than 5 kg within 90 days before screening, pre -
vious or planned surgical treatment for obesity, 
and treatment with a medication that promotes 
weight loss within 90 days before screening. A 
full list of eligibility criteria is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.A Quick Take

Procedures
After a 2-week screening period, participants were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 
tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or 
placebo, administered subcutaneously once week -
ly for 72 weeks as an adjunct to lifestyle inter -
vention. Lifestyle intervention included regular 
lifestyle counseling sessions, delivered by a dieti -
tian or a qualified health care professional, to 
help the participants adhere to healthful, bal -
anced meals, with a deficit of 500 calories per 
day, and at least 150 minutes of physical activity 
per week.
Treatment randomization was stratified by 
country, sex, and the presence or absence of 
prediabetes, as defined by the 2019 American 
Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care 
in Diabetes13 (see the Supplementary Appendix). 
All randomly assigned participants were to under -
go a planned 72-week treatment period that in -
cluded a dose-escalation period of up to 20 weeks. 
Tirzepatide was initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg 
once weekly (or matching placebo) and was in -
creased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks during the 
dose-escalation period to reach a maintenance 
dose of up to 15 mg once weekly by week 20 
(Fig. S1). After the 72-week treatment period, 
participants who had been without prediabetes 
at randomization proceeded to a 4-week safety 
follow-up period; those with prediabetes at ran -
domization continued in their original treat -
ment group for an additional 2-year trial treat -
ment period. This article reports findings from 
the 72-week treatment phase (the primary trial 
period) and the 4-week safety follow-up.
End Points and Assessments
The coprimary end points were the percentage 
change in body weight from baseline to week 
72 and a weight reduction of 5% or more at 
week 72. Key secondary end points included 
weight reduction of 10% or more, 15% or more, 
and 20% or more at week 72; the change in 
weight from baseline to week 20; and the 
change from baseline to week 72 in waist cir -
cumference, systolic blood pressure, fasting 
insulin and lipid levels, and the physical func -
tion score on the 36-Item Short Form Health 
Survey (SF-36), version 2, acute form. The per -
centage change in total body-fat mass from 
baseline to week 72 was assessed in a subgroup of 255 participants who underwent dual-energy 
x-ray absorptiometry.
Safety assessments included adverse events 
and serious adverse events that occurred during 
the reporting period. Laboratory assessments 
were conducted according to the protocol (see 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that a sample size of 2400 par -
ticipants would provide an effective power of 
greater than 90% to demonstrate the superiority 
of tirzepatide (10 mg, 15 mg, or both) to place -
bo, relative to the coprimary end points, each at 
a two-sided significance level of 0.025. The 
sample-size calculation assumed at least an 
11-percentage-point difference in the mean per -
centage weight reduction from baseline at 72 
weeks for tirzepatide (10 mg, 15 mg, or both) as 
compared with placebo, a common standard 
deviation of 10%, and a dropout rate of 25%.
Both efficacy and safety end points were ana -
lyzed with data from all randomly assigned 
participants (intention-to-treat population). Two 
estimands were used to assess treatment effica -
cy from different perspectives and accounted for 
intercurrent events differently: first, the “treat -
ment regimen” estimand, for which we used the 
treatment policy strategy in the ICH E9 (Interna -
tional Council on Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuti -
cals for Human Use [ICH] Statistical Principles 
for Clinical Trials [E9]) addendum on estimands 
and sensitivity analysis in clinical trials (R1)14), 
representing the average treatment effect of tir -
zepatide relative to placebo for all participants 
who had undergone randomization, regardless 
of treatment discontinuation, and second, the 
“efficacy” estimand, representing the average 
treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo 
for all participants who had undergone random -
ization, if the treatment was administered as 
intended (according to the hypothetical strategy 
in the ICH E9 [R1] addendum14).
Details on estimands, handling of missing 
values, and statistical analysis methods are pro -
vided in the Supplementary Appendix. All re -
ported results are for the treatment-regimen es -
timand unless stated otherwise. The type I error 
rate was strongly controlled within each esti -
mand independently for evaluation of coprimary

Results
Participants
The trial was conducted from December 2019 
through April 2022 and included 2539 partici -
pants (Table 1). Overall, 86.0% of participants 
completed the primary trial treatment period 
(88.4% to 89.8% across the tirzepatide groups 
and 77.0% in the placebo group) and 81.9% ad -
hered to the treatment or placebo as assigned 
(83.5% to 85.7% across the tirzepatide groups 
and 73.6% in the placebo group) (Fig. S2). Treat -
ment discontinuations due to adverse events 
were 4.3%, 7.1%, and 6.2% with 5 mg, 10 mg, 
and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and 2.6% 
with placebo.
Demographic and clinical baseline charac -
teristics were generally similar across treat -
ment groups (Table 1). The mean age of the 
participants was 44.9 years; most were female 
(67.5%) and White (70.6%); the mean body 
weight was 104.8 kg, the mean BMI was 38.0, 
and the mean waist circumference was 114.1 cm; 
94.5% of the participants had a BMI of 30 or 
higher. Participants reported an average dura -
tion of obesity of 14.4 years; 40.6% had pre -
diabetes at baseline, and nearly two thirds had 
one or more weight-related complications (Ta -
ble 1 and Table S1). Enrollment data according 
to country, U.S.-specific demographic data, 
and information on the representativeness of 
the trial participants are presented in Tables 
S1, S2, and S3, respectively.
Change in Body Weight
For the treatment-regimen estimand, the mean 
change in weight at week 72 was −15.0% (95% 
CI, −15.9 to −14.2) with a 5-mg weekly dose of 
tirzepatide, −19.5% (95% CI, −20.4 to −18.5) 
with a 10-mg dose, and −20.9% (95% CI, −21.8 
to −19.9) with a 15-mg dose and −3.1% (95% 
CI, −4.3 to −1.9) with placebo (Fig. 1A and 
Table 2). All three tirzepatide doses were su -
perior to placebo, with estimated treatment 
differences relative to placebo of −11.9 per -
centage points (95% CI, −13.4 to −10.4) for the 
5-mg dose, −16.4 percentage points (95% CI, −17.9 to −14.8) for the 10-mg dose, and −17.8 
percentage points (95% CI, −19.3 to −16.3) for 
the 15-mg dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons). 
At 20 weeks after randomization, treatment 
with tirzepatide resulted in a significantly 
greater weight reduction than that with pla -
cebo (Table 3).
For the efficacy estimand, the mean change 
in weight at week 72 with tirzepatide was 
−16.0% (95% CI, −16.8 to −15.2), a weight re -
duction of 16.1 kg (35.5 lb), with the 5-mg 
dose; −21.4% (95% CI, −22.2 to −20.6), a reduc -
tion of 22.2 kg (48.9 lb), with the 10-mg dose; 
and −22.5% (95% CI, −23.3 to −21.7), a reduc -
tion of 23.6 kg (52.0 lb) with the 15-mg dose, 
and the mean change with placebo was −2.4% 
(95% CI, −3.2 to−1.6), a reduction of 2.4 kg (5.3 lb) 
(Fig. 1B). The corresponding estimated treat -
ment differences with tirzepatide relative to 
placebo were −13.5 percentage points (95% CI, 
−14.6 to −12.5), −18.9 percentage points (95% 
CI, −20.0 to −17.8), and −20.1 percentage points 
(95% CI, −21.2 to −19.0) for the 5-mg, 10-mg, 
and 15-mg doses, respectively (Fig. 1B and 
Figs. S3, S4, and S5).
With the treatment-regimen estimand, 85% 
(95% CI, 82 to 89), 89% (95% CI, 86 to 92), and 
91% (95% CI, 88 to 94) of participants in the 
5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups, re -
spectively, had a body weight reduction of 5% or 
more at 72 weeks, as compared with 35% (95% 
CI, 30 to 39) of participants in the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). 
With use of the efficacy estimand, the respective 
percentages were 89% (95% CI, 87 to 92), 96% 
(95% CI, 95 to 98), 96% (95% CI, 95 to 98), and 
28% (95% CI, 24 to 31).
At week 72, more participants in the tirzepa -
tide groups had reductions in body weight of 
10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more 
from baseline than participants in the placebo 
group (P<0.001) (Fig. 1C and 1D). In addition, 
for the prespecified exploratory end point of a 
reduction in body weight of 25% or more, 15% 
(95% CI, 12 to 18), 32% (95% CI, 29 to 36), and 
36% (95% CI, 32 to 40) of participants in the 
5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups, re -
spectively, met this target, as compared with 
1.5% (95% CI, 0 to 3) of participants in the 
placebo group (Table 2).

Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Physical 
Function
Benefits with tirzepatide were noted with re -
spect to changes in waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin 
level, and lipid levels (Table 2, Table 3, and Figs. 
S6 and S7). At week 72, most (95.3%) of the 
participants with prediabetes at baseline in the Figure 1. Effect of Once-Weekly Tirzepatide, as Compared with Placebo, on Body Weight.
Least-squares means are presented, unless otherwise noted. Panel A shows the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 
72, derived from an analysis of covariance model for the treatment-regimen estimand (TRE). Panel B shows the percent change in body 
weight according to weeks since randomization, derived from a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis for the efficacy 
estimand; week 72 estimates for the treatment-regimen estimand are also shown. Panels C and D show the percentages of participants 
who had weight reductions of at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% from baseline to week 72. For Panel C, the percentage was calculat -
ed with the use of Rubin’s rules by combining the percentages of participants who met the target in imputed data sets. Missing values 
at week 72 were imputed with MMRM if the missingness was due solely to Covid-19 and with multiple imputation if the missingness 
was not due to Covid-19. For Panel D, the percentage of participants who met weight-reduction targets was obtained by dividing the 
number of participants reaching respective goals at week 72 by the number of participants with a baseline value and at least one non -
missing postbaseline value. Missing values at week 72 were imputed from MMRM analysis. I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.Tirzepatide, 5 mg Tirzepatide, 10 mg Tirzepatide, 15 mg Placebo

tirzepatide groups had reverted to normoglyce -
mia, as compared with 61.9% of participants in 
the placebo group.
The SF-36 physical function scores increased 
more with tirzepatide than with placebo, an in -
dication that participants’ perspective on their 
physical functioning was more likely to improve 
with tirzepatide (Table 3).
Treatment with tirzepatide was associated 
with greater improvements from baseline than 
that with placebo in all key secondary end points 
(Table 2 and Table 3). Additional efficacy data for 
the efficacy estimand are presented in Table S4.
Change in Body Composition
The mean reduction in total body fat mass was 
33.9% with tirzepatide, as compared with 8.2% with placebo, for an estimated treatment differ -
ence relative to placebo of −25.7 percentage 
points (95% CI, −31.4 to −20.0) in the subgroup 
of participants who underwent dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (efficacy estimand that included 
the 160 of 255 participants in the subgroup who 
had evaluable data at both baseline and week 72) 
(Fig. S8). The ratio of total fat mass to total lean 
mass decreased more with tirzepatide (from 0.93 
at baseline to 0.70 at week 72) than with placebo 
(from 0.95 to 0.88).
Safety
Overall, 78.9 to 81.8% of participants treated 
with tirzepatide reported at least one adverse 
event that emerged during the treatment period, 
as compared with 72.0% of participants in the Table 2. Primary and Secondary End Points for the Treatment-Regimen Estimand.*

placebo group (Table 4). The most frequently 
reported adverse events were gastrointestinal 
(nausea, diarrhea, and constipation). These ad -
verse events occurred in more participants in the 
tirzepatide groups than in the placebo group, 
were transient and mild to moderate in severity, 
and occurred primarily during the dose-escala -
tion period (Fig. S9).
Serious adverse events were reported by 160 
participants (6.3%) overall. Similar percentages 
of participants in the tirzepatide and placebo 
groups reported serious adverse events (Table 4). 
Overall, approximately 21% of serious adverse 
events were considered to be related to corona -
virus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which affected participants in all treatment groups (Table S5). 
Eleven deaths were reported: 4 (0.6%) in the 
5-mg tirzepatide group, 2 (0.3%) in the 10-mg 
group, 1 (0.2%) in the 15-mg group, and 4 
(0.6%) in the placebo group (Table S6).
There were four reported cases of adjudica -
tion-confirmed pancreatitis, evenly distributed 
across treatment groups, including the placebo 
group (Table 4). None were adjudicated as se -
vere. No cases of medullary thyroid cancer were 
reported. The reported incidence of cholelithia -
sis was similar among the tirzepatide and pla -
cebo groups. Cholecystitis and acute cholecysti -
tis were reported more frequently in the 
tirzepatide groups than in the placebo group, Table 3. Key Secondary and Additional Secondary End Points for Pooled Tirzepatide Dose Groups (Treatment-Regimen Estimand).*

although the incidences were low (≤0.6%) (Ta -
ble 4). Additional safety variables are described 
in Table 4 and Table S7.
Discussion
In the present trial, adults with obesity had aver -
age weight reductions of 19.5% and 20.9% with 
10-mg and 15-mg doses of tirzepatide, respec -
tively, as compared with a 3.1% weight reduction 
with placebo (treatment-regimen estimand). 
This is an unusually substantial degree of weight 
reduction in response to an antiobesity medica -
tion as compared with findings reported in 
other phase 3 clinical trials. Given that tirzepa -
tide is both a GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor 
agonist, we speculate that there may be additive 
benefit in targeting multiple endogenous nutri -
ent-stimulated hormone pathways that have 
been implicated in energy homeostasis.
A body-weight reduction of 5% or more has 
long been considered the threshold for clinically 
meaningful effect on the basis of improvement 
in metabolic health.15 It is remarkable that in this 
trial, the majority (89% to 91%) of participants 
receiving 10-mg or 15-mg doses of tirzepatide 
achieved this benchmark. Weight reductions of 
10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more 
yield additional clinical benefits,15,16 may be re -
quired for improvement in certain weight-related 
complications,17 and are often more desired 
therapeutic goals in clinical practice. The major -
ity of participants reached these three higher 
weight-loss targets (78–84%, 67–71%, and 50–
57%, respectively), across the 10-mg and 15-mg 
dose groups.
For perspective: the average placebo-adjusted 
weight reductions with older antiobesity medica -
tions that are currently approved by the FDA for 
the treatment of obesity are approximately 3.0 to 
8.6%,18 whereas a recently introduced antiobesity 
medication, semaglutide (2.4 mg), resulted in a 
placebo-adjusted weight reduction of 12.4%, 
with nearly one third of persons having a weight 
reduction of 20% or more.10 In the current trial, 
participants receiving the lowest maintenance 
dose of tirzepatide (5 mg) had a mean placebo-
adjusted weight reduction of 11.9% from base -
line, with 30% of participants reaching the 
weight-loss target of 20% or more. It is impor -
tant to note that no direct comparison of these 
trials can be made, since trial populations and designs differed. Finally, bariatric surgery re -
sults in weight reduction of approximately 25 to 
30% at 1 to 2 years.19,20 In the current trial, 
36.2% of participants in the 15-mg tirzepatide 
group met the prespecified exploratory end 
point of weight reduction of 25% or more. With 
substantial observed weight reductions at all 
three doses, tirzepatide may serve as an impor -
tant tool in the medical management of obesity.
The 10-mg and 15-mg tirzepatide groups 
were similar in mean percentage weight reduc -
tion, yet a higher proportion of participants in 
the 15-mg group met the 10% or more, 15% or 
more, and 20% or more weight-loss targets. The 
incidence of adverse events was similar in the 
10-mg and 15-mg groups. This finding suggests 
that the 15-mg dose may confer additional ben -
efits in some patients, without added safety 
concerns. It will be important to identify which 
patients may garner the greatest degree of ben -
efit from various doses of tirzepatide.
In the present trial, weight reduction with 
tirzepatide was accompanied by greater im -
provements with respect to all measured cardio -
vascular and metabolic risk factors, including 
waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, and fasting insulin, lipid, and aspar -
tate aminotransferase levels, than placebo. Par -
ticipants treated with tirzepatide had a percent 
reduction in fat mass approximately three times 
greater than the reduction in lean mass, result -
ing in an overall improvement in body composi -
tion. The ratio of fat-mass loss to lean-mass loss 
was similar to that reported with lifestyle-based 
and surgical treatments for obesity.21 In addi -
tion, nearly all participants (>95%) treated with 
tirzepatide who had prediabetes at baseline had 
converted to normoglycemia by the end of the 
primary trial period, as compared with 62% of 
participants who received placebo. These im -
provements may translate to reduced risk of 
cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 dia -
betes, among other outcomes.15,16,22 Future trials 
are needed to test this hypothesis.
The safety profile of tirzepatide was consis -
tent with previous findings in the SURPASS 
clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabe -
tes,23-27 and similar to other incretin-based thera -
pies for the treatment of obesity.9,10,28-30 As typi -
cally observed with these medications, transient, 
mostly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal events

treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists.9,10,31
Because the present trial was initiated in De -
cember 2019 and conducted almost entirely dur -
ing the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an ex -
pected impact on the incidence of adverse events. 
Close to 20% of participants tested positive for 
infection with the severe acute respiratory syn -
drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or had symp -
tomatic Covid-19 during the reporting period. 
There were 160 participants with serious adverse 
events in this trial. More than 20% of these par -
ticipants had serious adverse events judged to be 
related to Covid-19. Nearly one third of the 11 
deaths were directly attributed to Covid-19 (Ta -
ble S5).
Our trial had several strengths. Its global 
nature, large sample size, and overall high 
completion rate make the findings relatively 
generalizable. Overall, 86% (approximately 90% 
across the tirzepatide groups) of the participants 
completed the trial, despite the Covid-19 pan -
demic. The weight reduction in the placebo 
group was similar to results observed with pla -cebo in other recent obesity pharmacotherapy 
trials and is likely to reflect a similar level of 
adherence to the lifestyle intervention.9,10 Finally, 
the duration of the trial (72 weeks) enabled par -
ticipants to reach a weight plateau in the 5-mg 
group and near-plateaus in the 10-mg and 15-mg 
groups; the additional 2-year treatment period 
for participants with prediabetes should provide 
further insight into the maximum and long-term 
weight-lowering effect of tirzepatide in people 
with prediabetes.
This trial had certain limitations. The en -
rolled participants with obesity and overweight 
may represent a subpopulation with a greater 
commitment to weight-management efforts than 
the general population with obesity. Further -
more, the measured baseline cardiometabolic 
risk factors in the trial population, such as blood 
pressure and lipids, were relatively normal, pos -
sibly attenuating the potential to show improve -
ment, though meaningful changes in these 
variables were observed. Overall, only 5.5% of 
trial participants with overweight (BMI of 27 to 
<30) were included; further studies would be 
needed in such patients.
In the present trial, all three doses of once-
weekly tirzepatide demonstrated substantial and 
sustained weight reduction in adults with obesity.
