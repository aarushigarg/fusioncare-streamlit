Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver 
disease associated with liver-related complications and death. The efficacy and safety 
of tirzepatide, an agonist of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, in patients with MASH and moderate or severe fi -
brosis is unclear.
METHODS
We conducted a phase 2, dose-finding, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial involving participants with biopsy-confirmed MASH and 
stage F2 or F3 (moderate or severe) fibrosis. Participants were randomly assigned 
to receive once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo 
for 52 weeks. The primary end point was resolution of MASH without worsening of 
fibrosis at 52 weeks. A key secondary end point was an improvement (decrease) of 
at least one fibrosis stage without worsening of MASH.
RESULTS
Among 190 participants who had undergone randomization, 157 had liver-biopsy 
results at week 52 that could be evaluated, with missing values imputed under the 
assumption that they would follow the pattern of results in the placebo group. The 
percentage of participants who met the criteria for resolution of MASH without 
worsening of fibrosis was 10% in the placebo group, 44% in the 5-mg tirzepatide 
group (difference vs. placebo, 34 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
17 to 50), 56% in the 10-mg tirzepatide group (difference, 46 percentage points; 
95% CI, 29 to 62), and 62% in the 15-mg tirzepatide group (difference, 53 percent -
age points; 95% CI, 37 to 69) (P<0.001 for all three comparisons). The percentage 
of participants who had an improvement of at least one fibrosis stage without 
worsening of MASH was 30% in the placebo group, 55% in the 5-mg tirzepatide 
group (difference vs. placebo, 25 percentage points; 95% CI, 5 to 46), 51% in the 
10-mg tirzepatide group (difference, 22 percentage points; 95% CI, 1 to 42), and 51% 
in the 15-mg tirzepatide group (difference, 21 percentage points; 95% CI, 1 to 42). 
The most common adverse events in the tirzepatide groups were gastrointestinal 
events, and most were mild or moderate in severity.
CONCLUSIONS
In this phase 2 trial involving participants with MASH and moderate or severe fibro -
sis, treatment with tirzepatide for 52 weeks was more effective than placebo with 
respect to resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis. Larger and longer 
trials are needed to further assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for the 
treatment of MASH. (Funded by Eli Lilly; SYNERGY-NASH ClinicalTrials.gov num -

Metabolic dysfunction–associated 
steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known 
as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 
is a progressive liver disease that is characterized 
by excess fat accumulation in the liver, hepatic 
inflammation, and hepatocyte injury (histologi -
cally confirmed by the presence of ballooning), 
with or without fibrosis.1,2 MASH is associated 
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, 
and in patients who also have clinically signifi -
cant liver fibrosis, it conveys a higher risk of 
liver-related complications and death.2-4 The prev -
alence of MASH is increasing globally in parallel 
with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.2,5 In 
2019, MASH was the second most common in -
dication for liver transplantation and the most 
rapidly increasing indication.6
The beneficial effects of weight reduction on 
MASH are well documented.2,7,8 Higher incidences 
of resolution of MASH and regression of liver 
fibrosis have been observed with achievement of 
a weight reduction of 10% or more by means of 
lifestyle modification or with bariatric metabolic 
surgery.8,9 In phase 2 trials with 48-week and 72-
week treatment periods, glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonists have been shown to be 
efficacious for the resolution of MASH but not 
for regression of fibrosis.10,11 Tirzepatide, a once-
weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypep -
tide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist,12 has been 
shown to induce substantial weight reduction in 
placebo-controlled trials involving persons with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, or both.13-15 In 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment 
with tirzepatide resulted in a reduction in liver 
fat and improvement in biomarkers of MASH 
and fibrosis.16,17 Here we report the results of the 
SYNERGY-NASH trial, in which the efficacy and 
safety of tirzepatide was investigated in patients 
with biopsy-confirmed MASH and moderate or 
severe fibrosis.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The SYNERGY-NASH trial was a phase 2, multi -
center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-con -
trolled trial that was conducted at 130 sites in 
10 countries (see the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). The protocol (available at NEJM.org) was approved by the ethical review board at each 
site. The trial was conducted in accordance with 
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the 
International Council for Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable laws 
and regulations. All the participants provided 
written informed consent. The trial was designed 
by the sponsor (Eli Lilly) in collaboration with 
two academic authors; site monitoring, data col -
lation, and data analysis were performed by the 
sponsor. The first draft of the manuscript was 
written by the first and second authors. All the 
authors participated in the interpretation of the 
data, provided critical review of the manuscript, 
and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of 
the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol.
Participants
Eligible participants were 18 to 80 years of age 
and had a body-mass index (the weight in kilo -
grams divided by the square of the height in 
meters) between 27 and 50, with or without 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. Histologically confirmed 
inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MASH with 
stage 2 (F2) or 3 (F3) fibrosis (on a scale of 0 
[no fibrosis] to 4 [cirrhosis]) and a nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score of 4 or 
higher (on a scale of 0 to 8, with higher scores 
indicating more severe disease), with a score of 
1 or higher for each subcomponent (steatosis [on 
a scale of 0 to 3], hepatocellular ballooning [on a 
scale of 0 to 2], and lobular inflammation [on 
a scale of 0 to 3]). These criteria were evaluated 
by two central pathologists (academic authors) 
with the use of the NASH Clinical Research 
Network scoring system18 and on the basis of a 
liver biopsy that was performed at screening or 
no more than 6 months before screening. Key 
exclusion criteria were chronic liver disease 
other than MASH, cirrhosis, evidence of hepatic 
decompensation, excessive alcohol consump -
tion (defined as >14 standard drinks per week 
for women and >21 standard drinks per week 
for men), uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(as defined by a glycated hemoglobin level of 
>9.5%) and the use of confounding concomi -
tant medication (including GLP-1 receptor ago -
nists or medications that are intended to promote 
weight reduction). Full eligibility criteria are 
listed in the protocol.

n engl j med   nejm.org  3Tirzepatide for MASH with Liver Fibrosis
Procedures
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 
ratio to receive maintenance treatment with tir-
zepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or 
to receive placebo; all the doses were adminis -
tered subcutaneously once weekly for 52 weeks. 
Randomization was performed with the use of 
an interactive Web-response system (IWRS) and 
was stratified according to type 2 diabetes mel -
litus status (present vs. absent) and geographic 
region (Japan vs. United States or Mexico vs. 
Europe or Israel). The starting dose of tirzepa -
tide or placebo was 2.5 mg and was increased by 
2.5 mg every 4 weeks, in a blinded manner with 
the use of the IWRS, until the target mainte -
nance dose was attained. If dose escalation re -
sulted in adverse events, the investigators could 
reduce the dose to the next lower maintenance 
dose. Throughout the trial, all the participants 
received counseling regarding nutrition and 
physical activity in accordance with site pro -
grams.
A liver biopsy was planned to be performed at 
the end of the 52-week treatment period, and the 
results were evaluated by the central pathologists, 
who were unaware of the trial-group assign -
ments and the clinical characteristics of the par -
ticipants. In some cases, the biopsy was per -
formed before or after week 52 owing to early 
withdrawal from the trial, participant availabil -
ity, or delays in scheduling, particularly during 
the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Further 
details regarding the liver histologic evaluations 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
End Points and Assessments
The primary end point was resolution of MASH 
without worsening of fibrosis (defined as no 
increase in the fibrosis stage) at week 52. MASH 
resolution was defined as no steatotic liver dis -
ease (steatosis score of 0) or simple steatosis (a 
steatosis score of 1, 2, or 3) without steatohepa -
titis and an inflammation score of 0 or 1 and a 
ballooning score of 0. Secondary end points, all 
of which were assessed at week 52, were a de -
crease of at least one fibrosis stage without wors -
ening of MASH (defined as no increase in the 
NAFLD activity score), an increase of at least one 
fibrosis stage, a decrease of at least 2 points in 
the NAFLD activity score with a reduction of at 
least 1 point in at least two NAFLD activity score components (steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, 
and lobular inflammation), and changes in liver 
fat content (as assessed by means of the mag -
netic resonance imaging proton density fat frac -
tion [MRI-PDFF]) and body weight. Images from 
MRI were transmitted to a reader at a central 
facility (Perspectum) for evaluation.
A list of the exploratory end points is pro -
vided in the Supplementary Appendix. These end 
points include change in extracellular hepatic 
water content (which provides an indication of 
hepatic fibroinflammation19) as assessed by means 
of iron-corrected T1-weighted MRI, change in 
liver stiffness as measured by means of vibra -
tion-controlled transient elastography (FibroScan), 
changes in liver-enzyme levels, and changes in 
serum biomarkers of steatohepatitis and fibro -
sis, including the cytokeratin 18 and N-terminal 
type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3) levels, the 
scores on the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test and 
the Fibrosis-4 index, and the result of a noninva -
sive diagnostic blood test known as NIS4.
Safety assessments included adverse events, 
vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and 
electrocardiograms. Selected clinical events were 
adjudicated by an independent, external adjudi -
cation committee whose members were unaware 
of the trial-group assignments. Additional details 
of the trial design and procedures have been de -
scribed previously.20
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that a sample of 196 participants 
would provide the trial with at least 80% power 
to show the superiority of each tirzepatide dose 
level to placebo with respect to resolution of 
MASH without worsening of fibrosis (the pri -
mary end point) at a two-sided significance level 
of 0.05. The sample size was based on the as -
sumption that 42.5% of the participants in the 
tirzepatide groups and 12.5% of those in the 
placebo group would have a response and that 
20% of the participants would withdraw from 
the trial.
The efficacy end points were analyzed with 
the use of a treatment-regimen estimand that 
included data from all the participants who had 
undergone randomization; multiple imputation 
was used to handle missing data (see the Supple -
mentary Appendix). A prespecified analysis of 
the primary end point was performed in which

data from all the randomly assigned participants 
were included except for data obtained after 
permanent discontinuation of tirzepatide or pla -
cebo. The safety analyses included data obtained 
from all the randomly assigned participants dur -
ing the 52-week treatment period and a 4-week 
safety follow-up period.
Logistic regression was used to analyze all 
the binary end points. Comparisons among the 
trial groups for continuous variables that were 
assessed over time were analyzed with the use of 
either an analysis of covariance model or a 
mixed model for repeated measures. Analyses 
were adjusted for the stratification factors (type 
2 diabetes mellitus status and geographic re -
gion). All statistical analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute), or R software, version 4.2.2 (R Foun -
dation for Statistical Computing). No prespeci -
fied plan was made to adjust for multiple com -
parisons. The P values reported for the primary 
end point reflect a post hoc adjustment to ac -
commodate three dose comparisons against 
placebo; all the other end points are reported 
with the use of point estimates and 95% confi -
dence intervals. The confidence intervals have 
not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and 
should not be used to infer definitive treatment 
effects. An interim analysis for futility was per -
formed, and on the basis of the results, the trial 
was continued without modification (see the 
Supplementary Appendix). Further details are 
provided in the statistical analysis plan, available 
with the protocol.
Results
Participants
Between January 24, 2020, and January 10, 2023, 
a total of 190 participants underwent random -
ization. Overall, 165 participants (87%) completed 
the trial, 161 (85%) completed the trial regimen, 
and 157 (83%) had end-of-treatment liver-biopsy 
results that could be evaluated (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The percentage of 
participants who ultimately received the ran -
domly assigned dose with dose escalation was 
96%, 96%, and 85% in the 5-mg, 10-mg, and 
15-mg tirzepatide groups, respectively; after the 
target dose was reached, the dose was reduced 
in 0, 9 (20%), and 3 (7%) of these participants. 
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants at baseline were generally simi -
lar across the trial groups, except for the mean 
γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level, which was 
higher in the placebo group than in the tirzepa -
tide groups (Table 1 and Table S2). Most of the 
participants were White (86%) or Asian (12%), 
with 36% identifying as Hispanic or Latino. The 
mean age was 54.4 years, and the mean body-
mass index was 36.1; a total of 57% were wom -
en, and 58% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over -
all, 57% had stage F3 fibrosis; the incidence was 
higher in the placebo and 5-mg tirzepatide 
groups than in the other groups. Table S1 de -
scribes the representativeness of the trial popu -
lation.
Efficacy
The percentage of participants who met the cri -
teria for resolution of MASH without worsening 
of fibrosis (the primary end point) was signifi -
cantly higher in all three tirzepatide groups than 
in the placebo group (10%), with an incidence of 
44% in the 5-mg tirzepatide group (difference 
vs. placebo, 34 percentage points; 95% confi -
dence interval [CI], 17 to 50), 56% in the 10-mg 
tirzepatide group (difference, 46 percentage points; 
95% CI, 29 to 62), and 62% in the 15-mg tir  zep-
atide group (difference, 53 percentage points; 
95% CI, 36 to 69) (P<0.001 for all three com -
parisons) (Fig. 1A). The results of the analysis of 
the primary end point in which data from all the 
participants who had undergone randomization 
were included except for data obtained after 
permanent discontinuation of tirzepatide or pla -
cebo are provided in Figure S2.
The percentage of participants who had an 
improvement (decrease) of at least one fibrosis 
stage without worsening of MASH (a key sec -
ondary end point) was 30% in the placebo group, 
55% in the 5-mg tirzepatide group (difference vs. 
placebo, 25 percentage points; 95% CI, 5 to 46), 
51% in the 10-mg tirzepatide group (difference, 
22 percentage points; 95% CI, 1 to 42), and 51% 
in the 15-mg tirzepatide group (difference, 21 
percentage points; 95% CI, 1 to 42) (Fig. 1B). 
Reduction in fibrosis was more apparent among 
participants with stage F3 fibrosis than among 
those with stage F2 fibrosis, possibly owing to a 
lower placebo response (Fig. S3). Tirzepatide 
treatment did not have an apparent effect on the 
percentage of participants who had a decrease of 
at least two fibrosis stages without worsening of

MASH, an increase of at least one fibrosis stage, 
or an absence of fibrosis at week 52 (Fig. S4 and 
Table S3).
A decrease of at least 2 points in the NAFLD 
activity score with a reduction of at least 1 point 
in at least two NAFLD activity score components 
at week 52 occurred in 72 to 78% of the partici -
pants across the three tirzepatide groups and in 
37% of those in the placebo group (Fig. S5). 
Changes in the three components of the NAFLD 
activity score at week 52 were evaluated as an 
exploratory end point. In this analysis, 1-point 
improvements in the steatosis score occurred in 
62 to 75% of the participants in the tirzepatide 
groups and in 32% of those in the placebo group; 
1-point improvements in the lobular inflamma -
tion score occurred in 61 to 62% of those in 
the tirzepatide groups and in 36% of those in the 
placebo group; and 1-point improvements in 
the hepatocellular ballooning score occurred in 
77 to 82% of those in the tirzepatide groups and 
in 54% of those in the placebo group (Table S4).
Figure S6 shows changes in body weight after 
52 weeks in the overall trial population and in 
the subgroups of participants with or without 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the overall trial 
population, the mean percentage change in body 
weight was −10.7%, −13.3%, and −15.6% in the 
5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups, re -
spectively, as compared with −0.8% in the pla -
cebo group. There appeared to be an association 
between greater degrees of weight reduction and 
higher incidences of MASH resolution without 
worsening of fibrosis, but the relationship with 
weight reduction was less apparent for reduction 
in fibrosis without worsening of MASH (Fig. S7). 
Changes in serum lipid levels and glycated he -
moglobin levels are shown in Table S5.
Across the three doses of tirzepatide, reduc -
tions at week 52 were observed for serum levels 
of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (mean per -
centage decreases, 51.6 to 56.7%), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (42.1 to 47.7%), and 
GGT (39.3 to 49.0%) (Table 2 and Fig. 2 and 
Table S6 and Fig. S8). In a post hoc analysis, ALT 
levels had normalized (defined as a level of ≤30 
U per liter at week 52 in participants with a 
baseline level of >30 U per liter) in 47%, 64%, 
and 75% of the participants in the 5-mg, 10-mg, 
and 15-mg tirzepatide groups, respectively, and 
in 12% of those in the placebo group (Fig. S9). 
Changes in liver fat content (as assessed by MRI-PDFF), extracellular hepatic water content 
(as assessed by iron-corrected T1-weighted MRI), 
liver stiffness, NIS4 test results, the score on the 
Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test, the Pro-C3 level, 
the cytokeratin 18 level, and the score on the Fi -
brosis-4 index are shown in Table 2 and Table S6.
Safety
Overall, adverse events were reported in 92% of 
the participants in the tirzepatide groups and in 
83% of those in the placebo group (Table 3). The 
most common adverse events reported with tir-
zepatide were gastrointestinal events, and most 
(96%) were mild or moderate in severity. Discon -
tinuation of tirzepatide or placebo because of an 
adverse event occurred in 4% of the participants 
in the tirzepatide groups and also in 4% of those 
in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were 
reported in nine participants (6%) in the tirzepa -
tide groups and in three participants (6%) in the 
placebo group. A list of serious adverse events is 
provided in Table S7.
Adjudicated cases of progression to cirrhosis 
occurred in four participants (3%) in the tirzepa -
tide groups and in two participants (4%) in the 
placebo group (Table 3). There was no evidence 
of drug-induced liver injury (Fig. S10). One ad -
judicated major adverse cardiovascular event (a 
transient ischemic attack) occurred in the 5-mg 
tirzepatide group. Gallbladder-related adverse 
events were reported in four participants (3%) in 
the tirzepatide groups and in one participant 
(2%) in the placebo group. No cases of acute 
pancreatitis were reported.
Discussion
At 52 weeks, all three doses of tirzepatide — a 
once-weekly GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist — 
were superior to placebo with respect to resolu -
tion of MASH without worsening of fibrosis, the 
primary end point. Tirzepatide treatment was 
associated with changes in fibrosis, the NAFLD 
activity score, and the subscores for the indi -
vidual components of the NAFLD activity score, 
including steatosis, lobular inflammation, and 
hepatocellular ballooning. In addition, changes 
were observed in body weight; in blood markers 
of liver injury, including serum levels of ALT, 
AST, GGT, and cytokeratin 18; and in biomark -
ers of liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis such 
as liver fat content (as assessed by MRI-PDFF),

‡  The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
§  The fibrosis stages according to the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network are as follows: F0 indicates no fi-
brosis, F1 mild (perisinusoidal or periportal) fibrosis, F2 moderate (perisinusoidal and portal or periportal) fibrosis, F3 severe (bridging) 
fibrosis, and F4 cirrhosis.18
¶  The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score is the unweighted sum of scores for steatosis (on a scale of 0 to 3), lobular 
inflammation (on a scale of 0 to 3), and hepatocellular ballooning (on a scale of 0 to 2) and ranges from 0 to 8 on the basis of the NASH 
Clinical Research Network scoring system.18 Higher scores indicate more severe disease.
‖  Liver fat content was assessed by means of the magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF); values of 5% or 
higher are consistent with hepatic steatosis.2
**  Extracellular hepatic water content, which is a measure of hepatic fibroinflammation, was assessed by means of iron-corrected T1-
weighted MRI. Values of 875 msec or higher have a high specificity for metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with an 
NAFLD activity score of 4 or higher and a fibrosis stage of F2 or higher.19
††  Liver stiffness was assessed by means of vibration-controlled transient elastography (FibroScan). Higher values indicate more severe fibro-
sis. Advanced fibrosis is considered to be unlikely if the value is below 8 kPa and to be likely if the value is 12 kPa or higher.2
‡‡  The score on the Fibrosis-4 index is derived from platelet count, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and age. 
Advanced fibrosis is considered to be unlikely if the score is below 1.3 and to be likely if the score is 2.67 or higher.2
§§  The NIS4 test consists of a panel of four serum biomarkers, including microRNA-34a, α-2 macroglobulin, YKL-40, and glycated hemoglo-
bin. The presence of MASH with an NAFLD activity score of 4 or higher and a fibrosis stage of F2 or higher is considered to be unlikely if 
the value is below 0.36 and to be likely if the value is 0.63 or higher.21
¶¶  The Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test consists of a panel of three serum biomarkers associated with matrix turnover: hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase 1, and procollagen type III N-terminal peptide. Advanced fibrosis is considered to be unlikely if the value is below 7.7 and to be 
likely if the value is 9.8 or higher. A score of 9.8 or higher indicates an increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and liver-related clinical events.2
‖‖  N-terminal type III collagen propeptide (Pro-C3) is a serum biomarker that detects the formation of type III collagen. On the basis of the 
first-generation assay, a level of higher than 13.45 μg per liter was indicative of advanced fibrosis.22 The results shown here were measured 
with the use of the second generation assay; to compare these results with published data that were measured with the first-generation 
assay, multiply by 0.152.

Liver Fibrosis test, and NIS4 test results.
Weight reduction induced by lifestyle inter -
ventions, bariatric metabolic surgery, and the 
use of GLP-1 receptor agonists has a beneficial 
effect on MASH.7-9 Whereas previous trials have 
shown substantial reductions in body weight 
and liver fat with tirzepatide therapy,13-16 this 
trial included the use of histologic assessments 
to also show that treatment with tirzepatide led 
to a higher incidence of MASH resolution than 
placebo without worsening of fibrosis. The addi -
tion of GIP receptor agonism to GLP-1 receptor 
agonism not only increases the degree of weight 
reduction observed24 but also has direct effects 
on white adipose tissue that may benefit patients 
with MASH. In subcutaneous white adipose tis -
sue, GIP receptor activation increases blood flow 
in adipose tissue, augments postprandial triglyc -eride uptake, and improves insulin sensitivity.25,26 
In preclinical models, the insulin-sensitizing 
effects of GIP receptor agonism have been found 
to be independent of changes in body weight,27 
and in clinical trials, tirzepatide treatment yield -
ed greater improvements in insulin sensitivity 
than GLP-1 receptor agonists.28,29 Improved lipid 
storage in white adipose tissue may reduce ecto -
pic fat deposition in the liver.30 In addition to its 
effects on adipose tissue, tirzepatide increases 
fat oxidation during weight reduction.31
MASH resolution has been hypothesized to 
result in fibrosis regression and a reduction in 
major adverse liver outcomes (also known as 
MALO).4 In a natural history study, a decrease in 
disease activity was associated with an improve -
ment in fibrosis, and an increase in disease ac -
tivity was associated with fibrosis progression.32 
In an observational study, weight reduction in -
duced by bariatric metabolic surgery was shown 
to reduce major adverse liver outcomes.33 How -Figure 1. Primary and Key Secondary End Points.
Panel A shows the percentage of participants with resolution of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and no wors -
ening of fibrosis (defined as no increase in the fibrosis stage) at week 52 (primary end point). MASH resolution was defined as no stea -
totic liver disease (steatosis score of 0 [on a scale of 0 to 3]) or simple steatosis (a steatosis score of 1, 2, or 3) without steatohepatitis 
and an inflammation score of 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0 to 2) and a hepatocellular ballooning score of 0 (on a scale of 0 to 2); higher scores 
indicate more severe disease. Panel B shows the percentage of participants with an improvement (decrease) of at least one fibrosis 
stage and no worsening of MASH (defined as no increase in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score) at week 52 (key second -
ary end point). Risk differences indicate percentage-point differences between the groups. The confidence intervals have not been ad -
justed for multiple comparisons and should not be used to infer definitive effects of tirzepatide. The percentage estimates and risk dif -
ferences were calculated with the use of a logistic-regression model.23 I bars indicate standard errors.1062

ever, MASH resolution after surgery occurs more 
rapidly than regression of fibrosis. A longitudi -
nal study showed that a higher percentage of pa -
tients had an improvement of at least one fibrosis 
stage at 5 years after surgery than at 1 year.34 
Thus, treatment periods of longer than 52 to 72 
weeks may be needed to show substantial treat -
ment effects on fibrosis with pharmacologic agents 
that induce weight reduction. The relatively short duration of the SYNERGY-NASH trial (52 weeks) 
may account for the similar incidence of improve -
ment in fibrosis (51 to 55%) across the three 
doses of tirzepatide. Alternatively, fibrosis regres -
sion of approximately 50% may be the ceiling 
effect with weight reduction. In a recent trial, the 
incidence of MASH resolution after bariatric 
metabolic surgery did not increase further above 
a weight-reduction threshold of 20%.9 The use of Table 2. Changes from Baseline to Week 52 in Selected Liver End Points.*

tirzepatide in combination with other agents 
may lead to a higher incidence of fibrosis reduc -
tion; such agents may include fibroblast growth 
factor 21 analogues,35 pan-PPAR (peroxisome pro -
liferator–activated receptor) agonists,36 or thyroid 
hormone receptor beta–selective agonists.37
The safety profile of tirzepatide in this trial 
involving persons with MASH was consistent 
with that observed in previous phase 3 clinical 
trials involving persons with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, obesity, or both.13-16 Gastrointestinal 
events (nausea, diarrhea, and constipation) were 
the most commonly reported adverse events and 
were mostly mild or moderate in severity. The 
incidence of nausea and diarrhea was higher in 
both the placebo group and the tirzepatide 
groups of the current trial than in the corre -
sponding groups of the SURPASS-1 trial (a phase 
3 trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus)13 and the SURMOUNT-1 trial (a phase 
3 trial involving patients with obesity but with -out type 2 diabetes mellitus)14 (Fig. S11), but the 
incidence of adverse events leading to discon -
tinuation of tirzepatide or placebo was similar 
(Fig. S12). There were no reports of drug-induced 
liver injury or pancreatitis. No new safety signals 
were identified.
The strengths of this trial include its multi -
center, international, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled design. Liver-biopsy results 
were evaluated in a blinded manner by two ex -
pert liver pathologists. The histologic inclusion 
criteria and end points have been endorsed by 
both the Food and Drug Administration and the 
European Medicines Agency. The trial included 
adequate numbers of persons with and persons 
without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The key limitations of the trial were the 
sample size, which did not provide adequate 
statistical power to evaluate the effect of tirzepa -
tide on fibrosis while controlling for multiple 
comparisons, and the trial duration, which was Figure 2. Mean Liver-Enzyme Levels over Time.
Shown are the mean alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels from baseline through week 52 and during the  
subsequent 4-week safety follow-up period (SFU). Values were estimated with the use of a mixed model for repeated measures with log 
transformation, and the analysis included data for all the participants who had undergone randomization. Week 52 estimates for the 
treatment-regimen estimand (TRE) are also shown (see the Supplementary Appendix for details). The TRE included data obtained dur -
ing the treatment period for all the randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of tirzepatide or placebo, regardless 
of adherence to the trial drug. The mean values at baseline (top left of each graph) are geometric means from actual measurements at 
baseline. I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.Mean/uni0020Value/uni0020(U/liter)
