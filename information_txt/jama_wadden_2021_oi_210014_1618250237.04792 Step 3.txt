IMPORTANCE
Weight loss improves cardiometabolic risk factors in people with overweight or
obesity. Intensive lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy are the most effectivenoninvasive weight loss approaches.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg vs
placebo for weight management as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy with initiallow-calorie diet in adults with overweight or obesity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 68-week,
phase 3a study (STEP 3) conducted at 41 sites in the US from August 2018 to April 2020 inadults without diabetes (N = 611) and with either overweight (body mass index /H1135027) plus at
least 1 comorbidity or obesity (body mass index /H1135030).
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized (2:1) to semaglutide, 2.4 mg (n = 407) or
placebo (n = 204), both combined with a low-calorie diet for the first 8 weeks and intensivebehavioral therapy (ie, 30 counseling visits) during 68 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The co–primary end points were percentage change in body
weight and the loss of 5% or more of baseline weight by week 68. Confirmatory secondaryend points included losses of at least 10% or 15% of baseline weight.
RESULTS Of 611 randomized participants (495 women [81.0%], mean age 46 years [SD, 13],
body weight 105.8 kg [SD, 22.9], and body mass index 38.0 [SD, 6.7]), 567 (92.8%)completed the trial, and 505 (82.7%) were receiving treatment at trial end. At week 68, theestimated mean body weight change from baseline was –16.0% for semaglutide vs –5.7% forplacebo (difference, −10.3 percentage points [95% CI, −12.0 to −8.6]; P< .001). More
participants treated with semaglutide vs placebo lost at least 5% of baseline body weight(86.6% vs 47.6%, respectively; P< .001). A higher proportion of participants in the
semaglutide vs placebo group achieved weight losses of at least 10% or 15% (75.3% vs 27.0%and 55.8% vs 13.2%, re spectively; P< .001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more
frequent with semaglutide (82.8%) vs placebo (63.2%). Treatment was discontinued owingto these events in 3.4% of semaglutide participants vs 0% of placebo participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with overweight or obesity, once-weekly
subcutaneous semaglutide compared with placebo, used as an adjunct to intensivebehavioral therapy and initial low-calorie diet, resulted in significantly greater weight lossduring 68 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the durability of these findings.

Results
Study Participants
From August 2018 to November 2018, 742 participants werescreened, and 611 were randomized to treatment: 407 tosemaglutide and 204 to placebo. Overall, 567 participants(92.8%) completed the trial, and 505 (82.7%) completed thetrial in the on-treatment period ( Figure 1). The proportion of
participants permanently discontinuing trial product wassimilar between treatment groups (semaglutide, 16.7%; pla-cebo, 18.6%) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1 ). The most frequent
reasons for permanent discontinuation were adverse events(semaglutide, 6.4%; placebo, 2.9%), lost to follow-up (sema-glutide, 4.4%; placebo, 3.4%), and the category “other,”which included various personal reasons. Demographic andbaseline clinical characteristics were similar for the 2 groups(Table 1). Most participants were women (81.0%) and White
individuals (76.1%), with a mean age of 46 years. Mean bodyweight was 105.8 kg, mean BMI was 38.0, and mean waistcircumference was 113.0 cm. At screening, 75.8% of partici-pantshad1ormorecomorbidities.

aBody weight, vital signs, and glycated hemoglobin were assessed at screening
and randomization; all other laboratory measurements were assessed atrandomization only.
bRace and ethnicity were determined by the participant according to fixedselection categories with options of “other,” “not applicable,” or “unknown.”
cComorbidities included dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
cerebrovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired glucosemetabolism, reproductive system disorders, liver disease, kidney disease,osteoarthritis, gout, thyroid disease, and asthma/COPD. Information aboutcomorbidities judged to be relevant and significant for the trial population wascollected at screening, using specific disease forms based on information fromthe participants (yes/no answers).

both groups from baseline to week 68 (difference, 0.8 [95%
CI, –0.2 to 1.9]; P= .12) (Table 2; eTable 1 and eFigures 6 and
7inSupplement1 ).
Supportive Secondary End Points
Relativetotheplacebogroup,participantsinthesemaglutide
group were more likely to have lost 20% or more of baselinebody weight by week 68 (Table 2 and eTable 1 in Supple-
ment 1); 35.7% vs 3.7% achieved this weight-loss threshold
with semaglutide vs placebo, respectively (in-trial period)(Figure 2B and eFigure 4 in Supplement 1 ). Semaglutide was
associated with improvements vs placebo in BMI and dia-stolic blood pressure at week 68 (Table 2 and eTable 1 inSupplement 1 ). At week 68, levels of C-reactive protein and
lipids had improved with semaglutide relative to placebo,with the exception of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(Table 2 and eTable 1 in Supplement 1 ). Semaglutide was also
associated with a reduction in glycated hemoglobin com-pared with placebo (Table 2 and eTable 1 in Supplement 1 ).
From baseline to week 68, SF-36 physical component sum-mary score improved similarly in both groups, whereas themental component summary score favored semaglutide(Table2;eTable1andeFigure7in Supplement1 ).
Adverse Events
The proportion of participants reporting adverse events was
similar in the semaglutide and placebo groups (95.8% and96.1%, respectively). Gastrointestinal disorders (typicallynausea, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting) were the mostfrequent and occurred in more participants receiving sema-glutide(82.8%)thanplacebo(63.2%)( Table3).Mostgastroin-
testinaleventsweremildtomoderateandofrelativelyshortdu-ration (median duration of events: nausea [5 days in both
groups], vomiting [2 days in both groups], diarrhea [3 days inboth groups], and constipation [27 days with semaglutide vs16dayswithplacebo]),andthemajorityofparticipantsrecov-eredwithouttreatmentdiscontinuation(eFigure8in Supple-
ment 1). The proportion of participants experiencing nausea
with semaglutide peaked at approximately 25% at week 20and declined thereafter, remaining at approximately 15% forthedurationofthestudy.Atanygiventimeduringthestudy,theproportionofparticipantswhoexperiencedvomitingwaslessthan5%inbothtreatmentgroups.
Seriousadverseeventswerereportedin9.1%and2.9%of

Malignant neoplasms were reported in 3semaglutide-treated participants (0.7%; basal cell carci-noma, breast cancer, and papillary thyroid cancer) and 1placebo-treatedparticipant(0.5%;invasivelobularbreastcar-cinoma).

The present findings suggest that the addition of sema-
glutide to intensive behavioral therapy may help patientsachieve more than the average 5% to 10% reduction in bodyweighttypicallyproducedbybehavioralinterventionsat6to12months.
1,21Weightlosswithbehavioraltherapyoftenpla-
teaus at this level, despite patients’ continuing to haveobesity.
22Larger-than-expectedreductionsinrestingandnon-
resting energy expenditure that occur with weight loss(ie, metabolic adaptation), compensatory changes in otherhomeostatic regulators of body weight, and patients’ behav-ioral fatigue in adhering to diet and activity recommenda-tionsmaycontributetothe5%to10%weightreductionpla-teauobservedwithbehavioraltherapy.

2.4 mg, compared with placebo reduced self-reported hun-gerandfoodcravingsanddecreasedenergyintakeduringanadlibitumlunchby35%.

portions of participants treated with semaglutide comparedwithplacebowhoachievedcategoricalweightlossesofatleast10%,15%,or20%translatedintogreaterimprovementsinwaistcircumference, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin level,C-reactive protein level, and several lipid parameters. Ob-served benefits of weight loss might have been larger if par-ticipantshadbeenselectedbecauseofhavingelevatedriskfac-tors(eg,hypertension,hyperlipidemia),whichtheywerenotinthepresentstudy.

remaining events that contributed to the imbalance betweenthe semaglutide and placebo groups were distributed acrossseveral system organ classes, without apparent biologicalrelationshiptosemaglutide.
A question unanswered by the present study is whether
intensive behavioral therapy and an initial low-calorie, meal-replacement diet were necessary to achieve the long-termreduction in baseline weight seen with semaglutide. TheSTEP 1 trial examined semaglutide, 2.4 mg, combined withTable 3. Adverse Eventsa(continued)

a less-intensive lifestyle intervention program that provided
behavioral counseling visits every 4 weeks (ie, 18 sessions in68 weeks) and no initial low-calorie, meal-replacementdiet.
15,31Participants in STEP 1 lost 14.9% of baseline weight
with semaglutide at 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for pla-cebo plus the same lifestyle intervention.
31These findings
suggest that the inclusion of intensive behavioral therapyplus an 8-week low-calorie diet ultimately may not contrib-ute significant additional weight loss beyond that achievedby semaglutide and less-intensive lifestyle intervention. Fur-ther study is needed of the optimal program of lifestylemodificationrequiredwithsemaglutide,2.4mg.
