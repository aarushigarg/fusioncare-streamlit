ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS
The objective of the study was to explore the effects of semaglutide on kidney parameters in people with over-
weight or obesity.
The study sought to answer the question of whether semaglutide effectively reduces albuminuria and improves
estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate.
In people living with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide reduced albuminuria by 30% and
improved urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio status but did not affect estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate in people
with overweight/obesity with or without type 2 diabetes.
The reduction in albuminuria and improvement in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio status support ongoing trials
assessing the effects of semaglutide on long-term clinical kidney outcomes.Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/46/4/801/700506/dc221889.pdf by guest on 07 February 2024

OBJECTIVE
These post hoc analyses of the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obe-
sity (STEP) 1 –3 trials (NCT03548935, NCT03552757, and NCT03611582) explored
the effects of semaglutide (up to 2.4 mg) on kidney function.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
STEP 1 –3 included adults with overweight/obesity; STEP 2 patients also had type 2
diabetes. Participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0 mg (STEP2 only), 2.4 mg, or placebo for 68 weeks, plus lifestyle intervention (STEP 1 and 2) orintensive behavioral therapy (STEP 3). Changes in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio(UACR) and UACR status from baseline to week 68 were assessed for STEP 2.Changes in estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) were assessed from pooled
STEP 1 –3 data.
RESULTS
In STEP 2, 1,205 (99.6% total cohort) patients had UACR data; geometric mean
baseline UACR was 13.7, 12.5, and 13.2 mg/g with semaglutide 1.0 mg, 2.4 mg,
and placebo, respectively. At week 68, UACR changes were 214.8% and 220.6%
with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg, respectively, and +18.3% with placebo (be-
tween-group differences [95% CI] vs. placebo: 228.0% [ 237.3,217.3], P<
0.0001 for semaglutide 1.0 mg; 232.9% [ 241.6,223.0], P= 0.003 for semaglu-
tide 2.4 mg). UACR status improved in greater proportions of patients with sema-
glutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg versus placebo ( P=0 . 0 0 0 4a n d P= 0.0014, respectively).
In the pooled STEP 1 –3 analyses, 3,379 participants had eGFR data; there was
no difference between semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo in eGFR trajectories at
week 68.
CONCLUSIONS
Semaglutide improved UACR in adults with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabe-
tes. In participants with normal kidney function, semaglutide did not have an ef-fect on eGFR decline.1Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharma-

Clinical practice guidelines for patients
with type 2 diabetes recommend lifestyleinterventions, including increased physicalactivity and weight loss, glucose-loweringagents to optimize glycemic control, andpharmacological treatment with renin –
angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors andsodium –glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors to slow progression of kidney
function loss and reduce the incidenceof cardiovascular disease (CVD) events(1,2). Despite the fact that clinical trialshave demonstrated the ef ﬁcacy of these
lifestyle and pharmacological interven-tions (3 –10), residual cardiovascular (CV)
and kidney risk remains present even
with guideline-recommended treatment
(8,10). Part of this high residual risk ofkidney function decline is associated withthe biomarker of persistently elevatedlevels of albuminuria (11). New treat-ment strategies that further reduce bodyweight, improve glycemic control, and di-rectly or indirectly reduce albuminuria
are therefore needed.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ago-
nists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended byclinical practice guidelines for the treat-ment of type 2 diabetes and obesity toreduce CV risk (1,12). CV outcomes trialswith GLP-1RAs, including semaglutide,have demonstrated that these agents
reduce CV risk and slow kidney function
decline. These bene ﬁts may be partially
due to improvements in glycemic controlbut are likely also mediated by other ef-fects, such as reductions in blood pressure,body weight, and albuminuria, bene ﬁcial
effects on endothelial function, and inhibi-tion of proin ﬂammatory mediators (13).
The body weight –lowering effects of
GLP-1RAs are clinically important as the
prevalence of obesity continues to rise.In people with type 2 diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide dosesof 1.0 and 2.0 mg reduce body weight(14). A higher dose (2.4 mg once weekly)has been approved for the treatment ofoverweight and obesity (15,16). The Sem-
aglutide Treatment Effect in People with
obesity (STEP) clinical trial program exam-ined the effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg (ad-ministered subcutaneously once weekly)on body weight compared with placeboin people with overweight or obesity(17). The STEP 1, 2, 3, and 4 trials demon-strated that semaglutide 2.4 mg com-
pared with placebo, as adjunct to lifestyle
management or intensive behavioraltherapy, led to mean weight losses of
6–15% in participants with and without
type 2 diabetes (14,18 –20). The effects
of semaglutide 2.4 mg on albuminuriaand estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate
(eGFR) are unknown, as are the potentialbeneﬁts of semaglutide in patients using
and not using SGLT2 inhibitors. It is alsounknown whether the effects on albu-minuria can be explained by concomitantc h a n g e si ng l y c a t e dh e m o g l o b i n( H b A
1c),
body weight, and blood pressure.
The aims of these post hoc analyses
were to ﬁrst explore the effect of sema-
glutide compared with placebo on albu-minuria in patients with type 2 diabetes,as albuminuria was only measured in theSTEP 2 trial, and second, to assess the ef-fects of semaglutide on eGFR in a pooled
analysis of the STEP 1 –3t r i a l s .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Trial Designs
The current study is a post hoc analysis
of the STEP 1 –3 trials. The full methods,
trial pro ﬁle and patient ﬂow, and primary
results for the STEP 1 –3t r i a l sh a v ep r e v i -
ously been described (14,18,19). In brief,STEP 1 –3 (NCT03548935, NCT03552757,
and NCT03611582) were all phase 3a, dou-ble-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentert r i a l s .I nS T E P1a n d3 ,p a r t i c i p a n t sw e r e
randomized 2:1 to escalating doses of sem-
aglutide up to 2.4 mg/week or placebo for68 weeks as an adjunct to either lifestyleintervention (counseling on diet and physi-cal activity; STEP 1) or an initial meal-replacement diet plus intensive behavioraltherapy (low-calorie diet and intensivecounseling on diet and physical activity fol-lowed by randomization to semaglutide orplacebo to assess maintenance and/or fur-ther weight loss; STEP 3) (18,19). In STEP 2,participants were randomized 1:1:1 to68 weeks of semaglutide 2.4 mg, 1.0 mg,or placebo, all plus lifestyle intervention(similar to that in STEP 1) (14). In all trials,
semaglutide was initiated at 0.25 mg once
weekly and escalated every 4 weeks untilthe target dose was achieved (2.4 mg over16 weeks, or 1.0 mg over 8 weeks for par-ticipants assigned that dose in STEP 2). Atthe end of the 68-week double-blind treat-ment period, participants proceeded to a7-week off-drug follow-up period in eachtrial. All three trials were conducted ac-cording to the International Conferenceon Harmonisation Good Clinical PracticeGuideline and the Declaration of Helsinki;
all participants provided written informed
consent (14,18,19). STEP 4 was not in-cluded in this analysis because key differ-ences in trial design, including its 20-weekrun-in period in which all participants re-
ceived semaglutide, made it unsuitable to
pool the results with the STEP 1 –3t r i a l s .

1.73 m2(<60 mL/min/1.73 m2in those re-
ceiving SGLT2 inhibitors) in STEP 2 (14).
Outcomes
The coprimary outcome in STEP 1 –3
was the percent change from baseline
in body weight (alongside the achieve-
ment of $5% weight loss) as reported
previously (14,18,19). Changes in albu-minuria and eGFR were assessed as ex-ploratory post hoc outcomes (14,18,19).
Albuminuria was expressed as urine albu-
min-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Urinary al-bumin and creatinine were measured in acentral laboratory at weeks 0, 20, and68 in STEP 2 only; UACR was not measured
in STEP 1 or 3. The albuminuria-related
outcomes assessed from baseline toweek 68 were: mean percent change inurinary albumin concentration, mean per-cent change in UACR in the overall popula-
tion and in patient subgroups; proportions
of patients with normoalbuminuria (UACR<30 mg/g), microalbuminuria (UACR $30
to#300 mg/g), and macroalbuminuria
(UACR >300 mg/g); and proportions of
patients whose UACR status improved
or worsened. For the subgroup analysesof the change in UACR, patients were802 Semaglutide Improves Albuminuria in Obesity Diabetes Care Volume 46, April 2023Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/46/4/801/700506/dc221889.pdf by guest on 07 February 2024

grouped according to the following varia-
bles: baseline UACR ( <30 or$30 mg/g),
baseline systolic blood pressure ( <130 or
$130 mmHg), baseline eGFR ( <90 or
$90 mL/min/1.73 m2), baseline HbA 1c
(<8.0 or$8.0%), baseline BMI ( <35 or
$35 kg/m2), SGLT2 inhibitor use (yes/no),
and RAS inhibitor use (yes/no). For theanalysis of change in UACR status, an im-provement was de ﬁn e da sr e g r e s s i o nf r o m
microalbuminuria at baseline to normoal-buminuria, or macroalbuminuria at base-
line to micro-/normoalbuminuria by week
68, while a worsening was de ﬁned as ei-
ther progression from normoalbuminuriaat baseline to micro-/macroalbuminuria,or microalbuminuria at baseline to macro-
albuminuria by week 68. A mediation anal-
ysis was performed to investigate whetherthe effect of semaglutide in reducing UACRwas mediated by concomitant changes inHbA
1c, body weight, and blood pressure
from baseline to week 68.
Serum creatinine was measured at
screening and at weeks 20, 52, and 68
in STEP 1 –3. eGFR was calculated using
the Chronic Kidney Disease EpidemiologyCollaboration 2009 creatinine equation (21).A sensitivity analysis was performed usingthe race-free Chronic Kidney Disease Epide-
miology Collaboration 2021 creatinine equa-
tion (22). The change from baseline to week68 in eGFR was assessed in STEP 1 –3.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were based on the
trial product estimand (the secondaryestimand in the STEP trials), which as-sessed the treatment effect in all ran-
domized participants when each drug
was taken as intended. The analysesonly included data from all randomizedassigned participants until ﬁrst treat-
ment discontinuation or use of a rescue in-
tervention (initiation of other antiobesity
medications or bariatric surgery). Observeddata from the on-treatment observationperiod (during treatment with trial product;any dose of trial medication administeredwithin the previous 2 weeks [i.e., any pe-
riod of temporary treatment interruption
with trial product was excluded]) are re-ported for the following outcomes (STEP 2only unless otherwise stated): urinary albu-min by week, UACR by week, proportionsof patients by UACR status, proportions of
patients with an improvement or worsen-
i n gi nU A C Rs t a t u s ,a n de G F Rb yw e e k(STEP 1 –3). In a sensitivity analysis, theeffects of semaglutide versus placebo were
analyzed according to the treatment policy
estimand, which assessed the effect in allrandomized participants irrespective of dis-continuation of randomized treatment oruse of rescue medication. The proportionsof patients whose UACR status improvedwere compared by treatment using aChi-square test.
The changes from baseline to week 68
in urinary albumin concentration (STEP 2),UACR (STEP 2), and eGFR (STEP 1 –3) were
assessed using a mixed model for re-peated measurements with randomizedtreatment, randomization strati ﬁcation
groups (background type 2 diabetesmedication and HbA
1c;S T E P2o n l y ) ,
and the interaction between strati ﬁca-
tion groups (STEP 2 only) as factors andbaseline value of the outcome measureof interest as a covariate, all nestedwithin visit. For the subgroup analysisof the change in UACR, subgroup andthe interaction between treatment andsubgroup were also included in themodel as factors. None of the analyseswere adjusted for multiplicity.
The mediation analysis was performed
using the med ﬂex package in R (23). A
natural effects model was ﬁtted using an
imputation-based procedure (24), allow-ing for decomposition of the treatmenteffect estimates into natural direct and
indirect effect estimates. The percent me-
diated was then calculated as the naturalindirect effect divided by the total treat-ment effect and the CI obtained usingFieller ’sm e t h o d( 2 5 ) .
Urinary albumin and UACR were ana-
lyzed on a log scale as estimated ratios tobaseline (within treatment groups) and esti-mated treatment ratios (between treat-ment groups). For interpretation, data areexpressed as relative percent changes andestimated relative percent differences be-tween groups, respectively, calculated usingthe formula (estimated ratio /C01) × 100.
Pvalues<0.05 were considered to indicate
statistical signi ﬁcance. Analyses were per-
formed with R version 4.20/SAS version 9.4.No adjustment for multiple comparisonswas made, and as such, all results should beconsidered exploratory.

RESULTS
Participants
In STEP 2, the baseline characteristicswere well balanced among the threetreatment groups (Table 1). The geomet-ric mean (coef ﬁcient of variation) for
UACR at baseline was 13.2 (199.8) mg/g
in the placebo group and 13.7 (249.6) mg/g
and 12.5 (225.1) mg/g in the semaglutide1.0 mg and 2.4 mg treatment groups, re-spectively. A total of 248 participants hadUACR of $30 mg/g at baseline. In STEP 2,
the mean ± SD for eGFR at baseline was95.4 ± 18.1 and 96.3 ± 18.5 mL/min/1.73 m
2in the semaglutide 1.0 mg and
2.4 mg groups and 94.6 ± 19.3 mL/min/
1.73 m2in the placebo group.
Baseline characteristics for STEP 1 and
STEP 3 are presented in SupplementaryTables 1 and 2. The mean ± SD for eGFRat baseline in STEP 1 was 97.9 ± 16.9mL/min/1.73 m
2for semaglutide 2.4 mg
and 97.4 ± 16.7 mL/min/1.73 m2for pla-
cebo. In STEP 3, the mean ± SD for eGFR at
baseline was 98.6 ± 19.3 mL/min/1.73 m2
for semaglutide 2.4 mg and 98.5 ± 19.3 mL/
min/1.73 m2for placebo.

groups of patients are shown in Fig. 2.The effect of semaglutide compared with
placebo was consistent in subgroups by
baseline BMI, HbA 1c,e G F R ,o ru s eo fR A S
or SGLT2 inhibitors. The reduction in
UACR with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared
with placebo was more pronounced in
patients with microalbuminuria or macro-
albuminuria compared with patients with
normoalbuminuria ( P= 0.0009).
A higher proportion of patients on sem-
aglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 1.0 mg
had normoalbuminuria by week 68 com-
pared with those receiving placebo (87.1%
vs. 84.9% vs. 72.8%, respectively) (Fig. 1 B).
The percentage of patients with microalbu-
minuria and macroalbuminuria at week 68was lower in the semaglutide 2.4 mg and
1.0 mg treatment groups compared with
placebo (11.5% and 1.4% vs. 12.2%, and
2.9% vs. 22.4% and 4.8%, respectively).
The proportion of patients with a >30%

Effect of Semaglutide on UACR
Explained by Changes in HbA 1c, Body
Weight, and Systolic Blood Pressure
(STEP 2)
At week 68, patients receiving semaglutide
2.4 mg had placebo-corrected changes inHbA
1cof/C01.5% (95% CI /C01.7,/C01.4). The
corresponding changes in body weight andsystolic blood pressure were /C07.6% (95% CI
/C08.6,/C06.6) and /C04.8 mmHg (95% CI /C06.7,
/C02.9), respectively, for semaglutide 2.4 mg
versus placebo (14). To assess the extent towhich the effect of semaglutide on albumin-uria could be explained by concomitant
changes in HbA
1c, body weight, or systolic
blood pressure, the main analysis of changein UACR was repeated with adjustments forweek 68 changes in these parameters
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The effect of sema-
glutide 2.4 mg compared with placebo afteradjustment for HbA
1c, body weight, and sys-
tolic blood pressure was 58.6% (95% CI26.5, 97.8), suggesting that more than half
of the effect of semaglutide on UACR may
be related to its HbA
1c, body weight, and
systolic blood pressure –lowering effects
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Repeating the anal-ysis for semaglutide 1.0 mg revealed simi-
lar results (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Effects on Overall eGFR Change
(STEP 1 –3)
To characterize the effect of semaglutide
on kidney function, we pooled the data
from the STEP 1 –3 clinical trials, involving
3,379 participants with overweight orobesity with or without type 2 diabetes(data for the semaglutide 1.0 mg treat-ment arm from STEP 2 were not included
in this analysis, but are included for base-
line data). Of these participants, 1,262were assigned to placebo and 2,117 tosemaglutide 2.4 mg. Mean ± SD eGFR at
baseline was 99.3 ± 17.0 mL/min/1.73 m
2for the total population, and eGFR was<60 mL/min/1.73 m
2in 85 (2.5%) partic-
ipants. At week 68, no between-group
differences in eGFR were observed. Dur-
ing the total 68 weeks of treatment, the
rate of change in eGFR from baseline
did not differ between the semaglutide
(/C00.70% [95% CI /C01.17,/C00.22]) and pla-
cebo group ( /C00.21% [95% CI /C00.85,
0.42]; P= 0.2351) (Supplemen tary Fig. 5).
Results were similar for semaglutide 1.0
mg treatment versus placebo in the STEP 2
trial (Supplementary Fig. 6). Results were
also similar when the Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021
equation was used to estimate eGFR
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
Safety
Frequency of adverse events potentiallyrelated to kidney function (i.e., renal
and urinary disorders, acute kidney in-
jury, and renal impairment) were similar
across the STEP 1 and 2 trials and were
relatively low. In STEP 3, there were no
events of acute renal failure reported
(Table 2). Overall, semaglutide was well
tolerated with no increase in adverse
events leading to study drug discontinu-
ation. Nausea and vomiting occurred
more frequently with semaglutide than
placebo.
CONCLUSIONS
In the STEP phase 3a trials, semaglutide
has been shown to markedly reduce
body weight and improve glycemic
control in adults with overweight or
obesity with or without type 2 diabe-
tes (14,18 –20). In these post hoc explor-
atory analyses from the STEP program,
semaglutide signi ﬁcantly reduced albu-
minuria and increased the likelihood ofimprovement from a high to lower al-
buminuria category in the population
with type 2 diabetes (14). Semaglutided i dn o ta f f e c tt h er a t eo fc h a n g ei ne G F Rover time in the pool of participants fromthe three trials, of whom the vast major-ity had normal kidney function.
In patients with type 2 diabetes who
participated in the SUSTAIN 6 trial, sema-glutide 1.0 mg reduced albuminuria andthe risk of new-onset macroalbuminuria(26). This current analysis is the ﬁrst from
the STEP program to assess the effects ofthe semaglutide 2.4 mg dose on kidneyoutcomes. Numerically, a higher UACR re-duction was observed with semaglutide 2.4mg compared with the 1.0 mg dose, whichseems to con ﬁrm the albuminuria-lowering
effect of semaglutide. Moreover, bothdoses of semaglutide increased the prob-ability of regression in albuminuria cate-gories and reduced the likelihood of
progression to worsening albuminuria
categories.These effects are clinically rel-evant because therapies that reduce al-buminuria by 25 –30% are likely to confer
signiﬁcant bene ﬁts in reducing the risk of
long-term clinical kidney outcomes (27,28).These analyses also report for the ﬁrst time
that the albuminuria-lowering effects ofsemaglutide were consistent in patients us-ing or not using SGLT2 inhibitors.This is clin-ically relevant since SGLT2 inhibitors arenow guideline-recommended therapies forkidney protection in people with type 2 dia-betes, and guidelines suggest that semaglu-tide can be prescribed as an adjunct to RASinhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors to furtherreduce albuminuria (1,2).
The effects of semaglutide in reducing
albuminuria in STEP 2 were also consis-tent in patients with various degrees ofglycemic control and overweight or obe-
sity, supporting the generalizability of our

ﬁndings. The albuminuria-lowering effects
of semaglutide are more pronounced inpatients with micro- or macroalbuminuriaat higher risk, which may translate intolarger relative and absolute treatment ef-
fects on CV and kidney bene ﬁts, but this
hypothesis requires con ﬁr m a t i o ni nf u -
ture studies.
The mechanism by which semaglutide
reduces albuminuria may involve both di-
rect intrarenal and indirect effects outside
of the kidneys. The reductions in HbA
1c,
body weight, and blood pressure withsemaglutide may account in part for low-
ering albuminuria. Of these clinical param-
eters, the reduction in HbA
1cappears to
explain the largest part of the albumin-uria-lowering effect. However, some of
the bene ﬁt in lowering albuminuria does
not appear to be explained or accountedfor by changes in these parameters alone.Semaglutide may also reduce albuminuriathrough direct means that may lead to ben-
eﬁcial effects on endothelial function or the
endothelial glycocalyx, and increased natri-uresis, either through inhibition of the so-dium –hydrogen transporter or through
anti-in ﬂammatory or anti ﬁbrotic effects
(13,29). Mechanistic studies are ongoing tostudy potential mechanisms for how sema-glutide may confer kidney protection in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes (REMODEL;
NCT04865770) and in patients with over-weight or obesity (SMART; NCT04889183).
Semaglutide 2.4 mg had no appreciable
effect on eGFR over time compared with
placebo. Since kidney function was in the
normal range in the vast majority of par-ticipants at baseline, eGFR was only mod-estly decreased in the placebo group, andthus, it was not unexpected that there
was no effect with semaglutide in slowing
progressive kidney function loss, giventhe relatively short trial duration. TheFLOW trial (NCT03819153) in patients
with type 2 diabetes and established
chronic kidney disease (CKD) will deter-mine whether semaglutide 1.0 mg slowseGFR over time and reduces the risk of
kidney failure (30). For the eGFR pro ﬁle
over time, treatment with semaglutide2.4 mg reduced eGFR at 20 weeks. Thisinitial reduction in eGFR may suggest a fa-vorable hemodynamic effect on kidney
function since eGFR did not further de-
cline during the subsequent 48 weeks.However, a relatively large decrease ineGFR was also seen for placebo at week
20. An acute reduction in eGFR occurs
with other classes of kidney-protectivetherapies, such as RAS inhibitors and
SGLT2 inhibitors, and has been associatedwith long-term kidney protection (6,11,31,32). Dedicated mechanistic studies,such as the REMODEL and SMART studies,
are required to con ﬁrm if the observed ini-
tial reduction in eGFR with semaglutide re-ﬂects a salutary hemodynamic effect or
can be explained by other factors.
The effects of semaglutide on albu-
minuria and eGFR observed in the pre-
sent STEP analysis are consistent withpost hoc analyses of other GLP-1RA clin-ical trials. Dulaglutide and efpeglenatide
reduced albuminuria and the risk of a
composite kidney end point in two CVoutcomes trials involving patients withtype 2 diabetes at early stages of CKD
(33,34). Dulaglutide, compared with in-
sulin glargine, also reduced albuminuriaand slowed the decline in kidney func-tion in patients with type 2 diabetesand CKD (35). A post hoc analysis of the
SUSTAIN 1 –7 trials reported that sema-
glutide was associated with initial re-ductions in eGFR that plateaued duringchronic treatment (26). Similarly, in a
post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN-6 and
LEADER trials, treatment with semaglu-tide or liraglutide slowed eGFR declineand reduced the risk of substantial loss of
kidney function in patients with type 2 di-
abetes, with greater effects among thosewith preexisting CKD (36). More pro-nounced effects of GLP-1RAs in slowingkidney function decline among patients
with type 2 diabetes and established CKD
were also observed in the EXSCEL trial(37). This pattern of effect may potentiallyexplain why an effect was not observed
with semaglutide on eGFR in the pooled
STEP 1 –3 analysis, since the vast majority
of participants did not have CKD or werein very early stages of CKD.
These exploratory analyses have limita-
tions. First, the study was a post hoc
analysis of randomized controlled trials.Our results are therefore hypothesis gen-erating. Second, we recognize that by
design, the STEP 2 trial was not a dedi-
cated kidney outcome trial, and relativelyfew participants had established CKD. Ac-cordingly, since many participants hadbaseline clinical kidney parameters in
the normal range, effects on albumin-
uria cannot be directly generalized topeople with more advanced stages ofCKD. Third, there is considerable uncer-
tainty around the estimates of the propor-
tion of the albuminuria-lowering effect ofsemaglutide that is mediated by changes
in HbA
1c, body weight, and blood pres-
sure. Furthermore, the mediation analy-sis requires an assumption that no othervariables confound either the effect ofsemaglutide on albuminuria, HbA
1c,o r
body weight, or the associations among
these. As a result, the results of the me-
diation analysis should be interpretedwith caution. Fourth, albuminuria wasnot measured in the STEP 1 or STEP 3 tri-a l s ,a n dw ea r et h e r e f o r eu n a b l et og e n -eralize the albuminuria-lowering effectsof semaglutide to people with overweight
or obesity but without diabetes. Finally,
semaglutide reduces body weight, whichmay affect serum creatinine and eGFR.Additional studies measuring cystatin(38,39), an alternative ﬁltration marker
less in ﬂuenced by changes in body weight,
would provide more insight about the ef-
fects of semaglutide on eGFR over time
and to what extent serum creatinine –
based eGFR estimates are in ﬂuenced
by body weight changes.
In conclusion, in people with type 2
diabetes and overweight or obesity,semaglutide reduced UACR relative toplacebo, including in patients using RAS
inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors at base-
line. These results support ongoing trialsexamining the impact of semaglutide onkidney protection in individuals at highrisk of kidney disease progression.
