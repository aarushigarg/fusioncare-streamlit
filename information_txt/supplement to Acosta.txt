Supplemental Methods  
 
Phenotyping study:  
We studied a total of 450 participants with Obesity (defined as BMI >30 kg/m2). The study was approved by the 
Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent following thorough 
explanation of the study details. Women of childbearing potential had a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours 
prior to testing. All the studies were performed at the Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Trials Unit after an 8 hour 
fasting period. Participants completed a screen visit and a phenotype visit with the following tests performed in the order described and compl eted in one day: resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, gastric 
emptying of solids and liquids by scintigraphy, VAS for appetite score after gastric emptying breakfast, and 
satiation by means of an ad- libitum buffet meal ingested 4 hours after  the meal used to assess gastric emptying 
and VAS for appetite score after buffet meal test. We included men and women, age 18 -65 and have a stable 
weight for the previous 3 months. We excluded patients with recent use of weight loss medications (<6 
months ), history of abdominal GI surgery other than appendectomy, pregnancy, uncontrolled systemic disease, 
or medications that might interfere with motility, appetite or absorption.  
Phenotype tests methods  
• Resting energy expenditure was assessed by indirect ca lorimetry with a ventilated hood (Parvo Medics, 
Sandy, UT) (1, 2) . 
• Gastric emptying (GE) of solids was assessed by scintigraphy using a 320kcal 99mTc-radiolabeled egg, solid-
liquid meal. The primary endpoint was gastric half -emptying time (GE T 1/2)(3, 4) .   
• Satiation was measured by ad -libitum buffet meal test measured total caloric intake and macronutrient 
distribution in the chosen foods from standard foods of known nutrient composition: lasagna (Stouffers, Nestle USA, Inc., Solon, OH, USA]; vanilla pudding (Hunts, Kraft Foods North America, Tarrytown, NY, 
USA); and skim milk. The total kilocalories of food consumed and macronutrients ingested at the ad libitum 
meal were analyzed by validated software (ProNutra 3.0; Viocare Technologies Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) (3);  
• Appetite Score (hunger, fullness, satisfaction and desire to eat) was assessed by 100- mm visual analog score 
visual analog score fasting and postpra ndial after the standard meal for GE and after the Ad -libitum meal 
test; scores were obtained every 30 minutes for 2 hours (5) 
• DEXA scan (dual energy x -ray absorptiometry) was used to measure body composition(6).  
• Self-administered questionnaires: assessing affect, physical activity levels, attitudes, body image, and eating 
behavior; details of each questionnaire are provided below:  
• AUDIT -C Alcoholism Screening Test (7) - The AUDIT -C is a 3 -item alcohol  screening questionnaire 
that reliably identifies participants who are hazardous alcohol drinkers or have active alcohol use disorders.   
•  Eating Disorders Questionnaire  - The Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns -Revised (8), is a 
valid measure of screening for eating disorders in obese populations (9). 
• Body Image Satisfaction  - The Multid imensional Body- Self Relations Questionnaire (10, 11) provides a 
standardized attitudinal assessment of body image, normed from a national body- image survey. Items 
are rated on a 5 -point scale, ranging from 1=Definitely Disagree to 5=Definitely Agree.  
3 
 
• Eating Self -Efficacy -  The Weight Efficacy Life- Style Questionnaire (WEL) (12, 13)  is a 20 -item eating 
self-efficacy scale consisting of a total score and five situational factors: negative emotions, availability, 
social pressure, physical discomfort, and positive activities. Participants are as ked to rate their 
confidence about being able to successfully resist the urge to eat using a 10 -point scale ranging from 
0=not confident to 9=very confident.  
• Physical Activity Level -  The four -item Physical Activity Stages of Change Questionnaire (14) was 
utilized to assess the physical activity level of participants.  
• Exercise behavior - The Exercise Regulations Questionnaire (BREQ -3)(15) as a measure of the 
continuum of behavioral regulation in exercise psychology research, or as a unidim ensional index of the 
degree of self -determination. 
• Barriers to Increasing Physical Activity Participation  - Barriers to Being Active Quiz, What keeps you 
from being more active? (16). 
• Three Factor Eating Questionnaire  - is a 21 -item questionnair e, validated, to assess for emotional eating 
disorders and food cravings.(17)   
Statistical Analysis : with the intention to translate a quantifiable and reproducible obesity -phenotype 
classification based o n a specific a priori  determined cutoff, we selected the 75th percentile of each 
measurement in the first 100 females and males and then applied this cut -off to characterize the function for 
each phenotype (table 1).  We used this cutoff to identify the pr evalence of the five distinct phenotypes among 
the patients with obesity (Figure 1b). No further statistical analysis was performed as the obesity phenotypes 
described in figure s 2A-D as they were a priori  determined cutoff, and therefore will be artificia lly statistically 
significant.  
Phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy  
Rationale: Our basic hypothesis is that the classification of obesity based on pathophysiological phenotypes, 
serves as a clinical tool to identify the best responders to obesity interventions directed at their unique pathophysiological abnormalities. We tested 
the ‘actionable phenotype’ classification by assessing weight loss 
in response to tailored obesity treatment.  This approach could complement other approached in prevention of 
disease progression, consistent with the NIH -Precision Medicine Initiative (18). 
We previously tested the obesity phenotype approach with three FDA -approved me dications in, 
randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, proof -of-concept clinical trials (3, 6, 19)  and showed that a 
phenotype -tailored application may predict best responders for the following medications: Phentermine -
topirama te ER for the hungry brain phenotype (3),; and exenatide and liraglutide for the hungry gut phenotype (6, 
19). Additionally, the best responders for FDA -approved intragastric balloons may be patients with a hungry 
gut phenotype (20).  
 
Design and Eligibility Criteria:  
A comprehensive, prospective, pragmatic trial of phenotype -guided anti -obesity medications in patients with 
obesity in a multidisciplinary weight loss clinic was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board 
(IRB 17 -001068) and included patients e nrolled between June 1, 2017 and June 30, 2019. Treatment decisions 
were determined a priori  by a management approach; supported by our previously completed trials as well as 
the medications predominant mechanism of action (see below phenotype -guided anti -obesity medication 
guideline). We report the outcomes of 84 obesity phenotype -guided treated patients compared to 228 non-
phenotype treated patients (standard of care), who were assigned to either group based on clinical schedule 
4 
 
availability. The phenotype -guided group had their phenotype measured by clinically available tests (satiation 
test: nutrient drink test; satiety test: gastric emptying by scintigraphy; emotional hunger: validated 
questionnaires; and slow burn: indirect calorimetry resting energy e xpenditure). Patients outcomes were tracked 
through integrated medical record query tools (ACE -Advanced Cohort Explorer - and i2b2- Informatics for 
Integrating Biology and the Bedside ) and data was gathered from the electronic medical record. Participants 
included in the analysis met these inclusion criteria: 1) patients with a BMI ≥27 kg/m2 with adiposity -related 
co-morbidities or patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 with or without adiposity- related co -morbidities; 2) patients 
prescribed FDA -approved anti -obesity me dications; 3) follow -up of at least 3 months; and, 4) two or more face -
to-face visits with one of the physicians at the Mayo Clinic Weight Management Program. We excluded all 
patients who: 1) had prior major gastrointestinal surgery; 2) had prior endoscopi c weight loss intervention; 3) 
did not fill the medication prescription due to health insurance coverage denial and/or high drug cost, and 4) were taking FDA -approved anti -obesity medications prior to the first visit to the Mayo Clinic Weight 
Management Pr ogram, since such a prior prescription may conceivably confound the weight loss outcomes. All 
the information was collected from physician’s documentation including outcomes and adverse events. See CONSORT -extention guidelines checklist below .  
 
Mayo Clini c Weight Management Program: The Mayo Clinic Weight Management program involves a 
multidisciplinary team that includes 8 physicians (with an average experience in obesity medicine practice o f 15 
years), registered dietitians, advanced practice providers (Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants) and behavioral psychologists.  Upon initial evaluation, patients are encouraged to meet with a dietitian and with the 
behavioral psychology team.  Al l patients are encouraged but not obligated to participate in a standardized 12 
week behavioral program.  The general recommendations are to 1) reduce dietary intake to 1200–1500 calories 
per day for women and 1500–1800 calories per day for men, 2) achieve  a goal of 10,000 steps or more per day 
and 150 minutes or more of cardiovascular exercise per week, and 3) limit the consumption of liquid calories 
(sodas, juices, alcohol, etc.). Calorie restriction and counselling on activity might vary widely based on 
comorbidities and functional capacity.  
 
Flow of Participants in Pragmatic trial: Participants were assigned to a clinical appointment with a provider 
(MD/NP) offering either standard of care or phenotype -guided pharmacotherapy or phenotype -guided 
pharmaco therapy. The random assignment was performed when patients requested an appointment, not by a 
randomization code and allocation sequence, in order to reflect as much as possible, the principles of a 
pragmatic trial (21, 22)   (supplemental figure 1).  
 
Interventions: Patients prescribed with anti- obesity pharmacotherapy were divided into two groups: a group that 
received pharmacotherapy based on their phenotype, and a group of patients that were prescribed an anti -
obesity medication for other reasons (insurance coverage, previous success/non- success, avoidance of side 
effects, and patient preference). Patients were scheduled to return for follow -up visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months 
after anti -obesity pharmacotherapy is initiated. During each visit, information on weight l oss, adherence to 
medications and recommendations, and side effects were collected.  
 
Non-Phenotype -guided Pharmacotherapy for Obesity (Control group or Standard of care)  
Standard of care pharmacotherapy for obesity recommends the following doses and regime n for weight 
loss: 
5 
 
- Phentermine: 15- 37.5 mg oral daily 
- Phentermine -Topiramate Extended Release (Qsymia®) at dose of 3.23/23 mg to 15/82 mg oral 
daily  
-  Locarserin (Belviq®) at 10 -  20 mg daily 
- Oral naltrexone extended -release/bupropion extended- release (NBSR; Contrave®) at dose of 
32/360 mg oral daily (divided in 2 tables in morning and 2 tablets in evening)  
- Liraglutide (Saxenda®) at dose of 3 mg subcutaneous daily  
 
There is currently no gold- standard or first choice for obesity pharmacotherapy and physicians selected 
the medication to use on their patients based on physician/patient preference, medication interactions, 
comorbidities, risk of potential adverse events or insurance coverage (23-25). 
 
Phenotype -guided Pharmacotherapy for Obesity (Intervention group)  
Participants in the phenotype -guided pharmacotherapy for obesity group received their medication based 
on their obesity phenotype:  
- Hungry brain (abnormal satiation): Phentermine -Topiramate Extended Release (Qsymia®) at 
dose of 7.5/46 mg oral daily; or Loc arserin (Belviq®) at 20 mg daily 
- Hungry Gut (abnormal satiety):  Liraglutide (Saxenda®) 3 mg SQ daily  
- Emotional Hunger (abnormal hedonic eating): Oral naltrexone extended -release/bupropion 
extended -release (NBSR; Contrave®) at dose of 32/360 mg oral daily (divided in 2 tables in 
morning and 2 tablets in evening);  or 
- Slow Burn (low predicted energy expenditure): Phentermine 15 mg daily plus increase resistance training.  
 
Study End- Points : In this comprehensive, prospective, pragmatic trial of phenotype -guided anti -obesity 
medications the primary end- point was the percentage weight loss during 1- year follow -up for patients 
prescribed a FDA -approved anti -obesity medication. Thirty -two patients were excluded because they did not 
meet the inclusion criteria  due to “no” phenotype or were not able to start ‘assigned’ medication . There were no 
difference in demographics in the excluded patients (age [mean ± SEM)]: age 45.7 ± 2.3 years old, BMI 40.6 ± 
1.6 kg/m2, 75% females, 100% white, fasting glucose 107 ± 4.3 mg/dl) . 
 
The modified intention -to-treat cohort was defined, in accordance with protocol, as patients who were enrolled, 
received treatment and had at least 1 follow -up visit during the following 12 months.  We used the last 
observation carried forward to appraise trea tment efficacy. A per protocol analysis was based on participants 
who completed 3, 6, 9, or 12 months of treatment and follow -up. Secondary endpoints included the proportion 
of patients who had a reduction from baseline body weight of ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥ 20%.  
 
Statistical analysis: All continuous data are summarized as means and SEM. Categorical data are presented as 
frequencies and percentages. We used Pearson χ2 and unpaired Student, two -tailed  t-test for between -group 
comparisons for baseline nominal and ordinal variables. All P -values <0.05 were considered statistically 
significant.

 ABSTRACT  
Introduction:  Obesity prevalence continues to increase worldwide[ 7] and, in the United States, 69% of adults 
are overweight or obese [8]. Despite advances in understanding of aspects of obesity pathophysiology, weight 
loss w ith current treatments including diet, exercise, medications, endoscopy and surgery is highly variable [9]. 
However, there are usually great responders to each therapy, specifically “responders” to medications can lose 
as much weight and with less side effect s than bariatric surgery. These individuals –  the responders – can 
benefit from significant weight loss (>15% total body weight loss) which is known to reduce all -cause 
cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. With the current approach with pharmacotherapy,  less than 20% of 
patients will lose more than 10% of body weight. Additionally, the high variability in weight loss response has 
resulted in a poor market penetrance by new medications, devices and surgery. Clearly the one -treatment -fits 
all is not workin g and obesity management continue to be a hit -or-miss intervention. Thus, it is essential to 
identify the responders to each intervention, to maximize their weight loss.  Recently, we made significant 
progress to identify predictors of weight loss using gastrointestinal and behavioral traits (phenotypes) [3]. 
Obesity can be sub -classified based on specific phenotypes in satiation (21%), gastric capacity (15%), 
behavioral (13%), gastric sensorimotor (11%) factors and others (40%) [3]. This obesity sub- classification  may 
predict  weight loss response to pharmacotherapy and bariatric endoscopy  [3, 10-12]. Using this classification, 
the effect on weight loss of Phentermine- topiramate ER [3], exenatide 5ug and Liraglutide 3mg is maximized 
[10]. However,  these results were determined retrospectively  (post -hoc analysis)  and each study  was done 
independently. T hus, t he identification of the obesity phenotype at baseline to guide obesity pharmacotherapy 
has not been tested yet and the outcome is unknown in the clinical setting . Thus, there is a critical need to 
study the weight loss outcome using obesity phenotypes to guide therapy for obesity. We hypothesize 
that t he identification of the obesity phenotype at baseline to guide obesity pharmacotherapy will enhance the 
weight loss response rate (i .e. percentage of patient with weight loss higher than 10 % at 12 weeks) .  
Aim:  To compare the weight loss response rate to obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy vs. controls . 
Methods:  In a 12 week, pragmatic , 1:1 paralleled controlled trial of 20 0 participants with obesity;  we will 
compare the weight loss response rate to obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy vs. standard of care in 
the Mayo Clinic Weight Management and Nutrition Clinic  (See flow diagram below, Figure 1) . Patients that are 
interest in Weight Management with medications will be randomized (at the clinical triage scheduling system) 
to be offered a diagnostic test to use an obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy (Intervention). A similar 
cohort who will  not be offered the test wil l be followed in parallel in a prospective manner (standard of care 
group). When patients are assigned to the physician in the Intervention clinic, they will be offered the 
diagnostic tests as part of their care, but at no cost for the patient  and the test s will be done under informed 
consent . The results of the tests  will guide obesity pharmacotherapy  (figure 1 ). All participants will be contact ed 
at 4 and seen at  12 weeks  (current standard in practice) . All p articipants will receive a  standard intense lifestyle 
intervention, which consists of 2 -4 visits with registered  dietitian and one visit with a behavioral psychologist . 
The phenotypic studies include (all performed in same day  in the following order ): Fasting blood collection, 
resting energy expendi ture, g astric emptying with meal for breakfast,  behavioral questionnaires , and nutri ent 
drink test for lunch . Blood will be collected assessment of metabolomic biomarkers, gastrointestinal hormones 
(GLP -1, PYY, CCK, bile acids), DNA  (blood and buccal swab)  and pharmacogenomics . Stool samples for 
microbiome.  
Primary endpoint:  Percentage of responders (defined as number of participants who loss 10% or more of 
total body weight) compared to baseline in the obesity phenotype guided  pharmacotherapy  (intervention) group  
vs. standard of care at 12 weeks . The secondary end points will be percentage of responders with at least 5% 
at 4 weeks , 15% at 12 weeks , and 10% at 6 months and 12 months ; side effects of medications and patient  
satisfaction.   
Sample size assessment:  We propose a 1:1 design to compare effects of I ntervention compared to Standard 
of Care in weight loss. The analysis will involve use of 2- way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model s with 
treatment ; and the covariates to be considered incl ude gender, BMI (at baseline).  The current standard of care  
suggest s that approximate 35% of patients will lose more than 10% of body weight [1, 6, 13-15]. We estimate a 
detectable effect size difference (Δ) in percentage of responders for the intervention group compare to 
standard of care of more than 20% (55% intervention vs. 35% control) . Using this proportion of responders [2, 
5, 16-18], the sample size will be 100  participants in intervention group and 100 participants in standard of care 
group to demonstrate a treatment -related difference in weight loss (using α=0.05, 80% power, 2- sided t test).  
Significance:  Our study individualizes obesity treatment to maximize pharmacotherapy outcome based on 
phenotyping obesity at baseline.

 BACKGROUND 
 
Obesity prevalence continues to increase worldwide[ 7] and, in the United States, 69% of adults are 
overweight or obese [8]. Estimate d costs to the healthcare system are more than $550 billion annually. 
Increased severity of obesity correlates with a higher prevalence of the associated co -morbidities. Likewise, 
obesity increases the risk of premature mortality [19]. Obesity affects almost every organ system in the body 
and increases the risk of numerous diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
cardiovascular disease, and cancer. It is estimated that a man in his twenties with a BMI over 45 will have a 
22% reduction (13 years) in life expectancy.  
Despite advances in understanding of aspects of obesity pathophysiology, weight loss with current 
treatments including diet, exercise, medications, endoscopy and surgery is highly variable [9]. However, there 
are usually great responders to each therapy, specifically “responders” to medications can lose as much 
weight and with less side effects than bariatric surgery. These individuals – the responders –  can benefit from 
significant weight loss  (>15% total body weight loss) which is known to reduce all -cause cardiovascular 
mortality and morbidity. For example, the high dose of extended release (ER) phentermine -topiramate was 
associated with an average weight loss of 9.8%; only 48% of patients lost more than 10% of body weight, 
whereas 30% of patients lost less than 5% body weight [ 5]. Additionally, the high variability in weight loss 
response has resulted in a poor market penetrance by new medications, devices and surgery. Clearly the one-
treatment -fits all is not working and obesity management continue to be a hit -or-miss intervention. Thus, it is 
essential to identify the responders to each intervention, to maximize their weight loss.  Recently, we made 
significant progress to identi fy predictors of weight loss using gastrointestinal and behavioral traits [3]. 
Treatment for obesity:  
The 2013 Obesity Guidelines suggest that to achieve weight loss, an energy deficit is essential. Reducing 
dietary energy intake below that required for energy balance can be achieved through a reduction of daily 
calories to 1200- 1500 for women, and 1,500 -1800 for men (kilocalorie levels are usually adjusted for the 
individual’s body weight and physical activity levels); or estimation of individual daily energy requirements and 
prescription of an energy deficit of 500 kcal/d or 750 kcal/d. Recommendations for young children through 
adolescence vary in order to support normal growth and development occurring during these years.  The 
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library recommends no fewer than 900 kcal/day for 6 -12 
year olds who are medically monitored and no fewer than 1200 kcal/day for 13 -18 year olds (Academy of 
Nutrition and Dietetics Weight Management Position Paper which provides an overview of a nutrition assessment: http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position- and-practi ce-papers/position- papers/weight -
management).  Evidence supports greatest long- term success with an individualized, structured meal plan in 
place. A registered dietitian nutritionist can play an important role in designing the nutrition intervention tailor ed 
to address each patient’s unique needs and circumstances, taking into consideration factors such as insulin resistance. Any diet program that meets this required energy deficit is appropriate to adopt, and comparative 
trials have shown no long -term superiority between different macronutrient composition or elimination diets. 
Furthermore, it is important to adhere to a balanced diet that provides a variety of items from all food groups and limits potentially harmful food ingredients like added sugars, sodium and alcohol. Additionally, guidelines  
recommend limiting or avoiding liquid calories (i.e. sodas, juices, alcohol, etc.). And, finally, the meal plan 
should be designed in such a way that the individual is likely to follow it.  
Along with the prescripti on for a reduced calorie diet, a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program should 
prescribe increased aerobic physical activity (such as brisk walking) for ≥150 min/week (equal to ≥30 min/d 
most days of the week), and a goal of >10,000 steps per day. Hi gher levels of physical activity, approximately 
200 to 300 min/wk., are recommended to maintain the weight lost or minimize weight regain in the long term 
(>1 year ) [20]. The diet and physical activity can be in combination with a hospital/university or commercial 
behavior program; these are comprehensive lifestyle interventions that us ually provide structured behavior 
strategies to facilitate adherence to diet and activity recommendations. These strategies include regular self -
monitoring of food intake, body weight, physical activity, and food cravings. These same behaviors are recommended to maintain lost weight, with the addition of frequent (i.e., weekly or more frequent) monitoring of 
body weight [21].

topiramate on bodyweight. Patients with at 
least 5% and at least 10% weight loss.  [5] 
Pharmacotherapy  
In addition to diet, exercise and behavioral modification, pharmacotherapies should be considered as an 
adjunct to lifestyle changes in patients who have been unable to lose and maintain weight with diet and 
exercise alone. They should also be considered in people whose history or clinical circumstances require 
expedited weight loss. Medication should not be used alone, but in combination with an intensive lifestyle 
program.  
Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity can be considered if a patient has a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 
kg/m2 or a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with weight -related co -morbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, 
dyslipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea[ 21]. Medical therapy should be initiated with dose escalation based 
on efficacy and tolerability to the recommended dose.  A n assessment of efficacy and safety at least monthly 
for the first three months and then at least every three months. In patients who have cardiovascular disease, 
guidelines recommend against prescribing sympathomimetic agents such as phentermine and 
phentermine/topiramate extended release (ER).  Lorcaserin and orlistat are safer alternatives.  In patients with 
T2DM, the guidelines suggest antidiabetic agents that promote weight loss such as glucagon- like peptide 
(GLP -1) analogs which reduce hyperglycemia in addition to the first -line agent for T2DM, metformin[ 22].

on treatment arms wi th different doses), subjects lost 10.2 kg 
on15/92 mg combination therapy vs. 1.4 kg on placebo over 56 weeks [14]. The most common adverse events were dry mouth, 
paresthesias, constipation, insomnia, dizziness, and dysgeusia. 
Depression-  and anxiety -related adverse events were also 
observed. The medication had favorable effects on glycemia, including prevent progression to diabetes, improvements in lipids, 
blood pr essure, sleep apnea, and quality of life measures. There 
was also, as previously noted, a small but consistent increase in 
pulse rate [ 25]. The overall rate of adverse effects decreased in 
weeks 56– 108 compared to weeks 0– 56; among which dry 
mouth, c onstipation and paresthesias were the most prevalent 
There were 19 pregnancies carried to term during these studies none of which resulted in congenital abnormalities [ 17, 25, 26]. 
In July 2012, the FDA voted for approval of phentermine (3.75– 15mg/d) plus extended release topiramate (23–
92mg/d) as an adjunct to diet and physical activity for treatment of obesity among adult individuals with 
BMI≥30kg/m
2 or BMI≥27kg/m2 with at least one obesit y-related comorbid condition. The drug will carry a

 trimester of gestation and will be subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) t hat will restrict 
prescribing to trained clinicians, will require effective contraception and monthly pregnancy tests for 
reproductive age women, and will restrict dispensing to specific mail -order pharmacies. The company is also 
required to carry a long- term cardiovascular outcomes trial. No randomized pediatric studies have as yet been 
reported. Noteworthy, the high dose of PhenTop was associated with a mean weight loss of 9.8%; however, 
only 48% of patients lost >10% of their body weight, and 30 % 
of pati ents lost <5% of their body weight. The high variability of 
weight loss response to treatment with PhenTop is unclear.   
Lorcaserin (Belviq®): The second medication approved by 
the FDA in 2012 for chronic weight management is 
lorcaserin[ 27]. It is a serotonin receptor agonist thought to 
reduce food intake and  increase satiety by selectively 
activating receptors on anorexigenic POMC neurons in the 
hypothalamus.  At the recommended dose, lorcaserin 
selectively binds to 5 -HT2C receptors instead of 5- HT2A and 
5-HT2B receptors, which are associated with hallucinati ons 
and cardiac valve insufficiency respectively [28].  The 
recommended dose of lorcaserin is 10 mg twice daily.  The 
medication should be discontinued if ≥ 5% weight loss is not 
achieved after 12 weeks  (Figure 3) [6].  
Oral naltrexone extended- release/bupropion extended- release (NBSR; Contrave®, Mysimba™) is 
available as an adjunct to a reduced- calorie diet and increased physical activity in adults with an initial body 
mass index (BMI) of ≥30  kg/m2 (i.e. obese) or a BMI of ≥27  kg/m2 (i.e. overweight) in the presence of at least 
one bodyweight -related comorbidity, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension or dyslipidemia. In 56 -
week phase III trials in these patient populations, oral naltrexone ER/bupropion ER 32/360  mg/day was 
significantly more effective than placebo wi th regard to 
percentage bodyweight reductions from baseline and the 
proportion of patients who achieved bodyweight reductions of ≥5 
and ≥10  % (table 1) [1, 16, 29]. Significantly greater improvements 
in several cardiometabolic risk factors were also observed with naltrexone ER/bupropion ER versus placebo, as well as greater 
improvements in glycated hemoglobin levels in obese or 
overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. Naltrexone ER/bupropion 
ER was generally well tolerated in phase III trials, with nausea 
being the most common adverse event (table 2) [16, 29]. Thus, 
naltrexone ER/bupropion ER 32/360  mg/day as an adjunct to a 
reduced- calorie diet and increased physical activity is an effective 
and well -tolerated option for chronic bodyweight management in 
obese adults or overweight adults with at least one bodyweight -
related comorbidity.   
Noteworthy, the high dose of NBSR was associated with a mean 
weight loss of 8.1%; however, only 34% of patients lost >10% of their body weight, and 62% of patients lost 
<5% of their body weight. The high variability of weight loss response to treatment with NBSR is unclear.  
Liraglutide (Saxenda®)  is a glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) analogue with 97% homology to human GLP -1, 
a gut derived incretin hormone[ 27]. Liraglutide was approved in 2010 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes at 
doses up to 1.8 mg daily.  In phase III studies many patients on liraglutide for diabetes lost weight in a dose -
dependent manner [30] and the efficacy was similar in patients with obesity without diabetes [15]. The FDA 
approved liraglutide in 2014 as Saxenda at 3.0 mg dose for chronic weight management in patients with 
obesity.  Weight loss is mediated by reduced energy intake by reducing appetite, increasing satiety and delaying gastric emptying [10, 31]. Liraglutide is administered as a subcutaneous injection once daily.  It is 
initiated at 0.6 mg daily for one week with instructions to increase by 0.6 mg weekly until 3.0 mg is reached.

Slower dose titration is effective in managing 
gastrointestinal side effects.  The medication should be 
discontinued if a patient has achieved ≤ 4% weight loss 
at 16 weeks.  
The average weight loss in a large NEJM -published trial 
[2] of liraglutide was ~8% of body weight; 33% of 
participants lost >10% and 14.4% lost >15% of body weight.   However, 36.8% of patients did not respond to 
treatment with lira glutide (figure 4). The reason for the 
high variability of weight loss response to treatment with liraglutide is unclear.  
Pharmacogenomics   
Pharmacogenomics  (PGx)  is a new field in individualized 
medicine generally concerned with genetic 
polymorphisms in drug -metabolizing enzymes, 
transporters, receptors, and drug targets that explain inter -individual variation in drug efficacy and toxicity [41].  
PGx has the potential to improve clinical outcomes by using an individual’s genotype to inform personalization 
and optimization of drug therapy. A large number of PGx variants with demonstrated clinical utility are known 
and have been incorporated into drug labeling by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [2].  As the 
availability of high throughput genomics technology becomes more widespread and the associated cost of 
genetic testing more economical, opportunities for patients to have precision genomic information to guide 
healthcare decisions is expected to increase. Integration of genetic data into the clinical decision making process has the potential to significantly advance the practice of precision medicine and in the case of PGx, 
ultimately affect every patient.   Mayo Clinic’s Individualized Medicine Clinic (within the Center for Individualized 
Medicine) has established a Pharmacogenomics Testing Service. Largely an interest for “otherwise healthy” 
patients, or those self -reporting medication struggles, these pat ients can be referred for testing and/or 
consultation/evaluation by a PGx expert pharmacist who will help facilitate a PGx laboratory test in partnership with the referring physician. The PGx pharmacists can also assist with interpretation of the results —given the 
newness of the field and level of exposure to PGx testing across physicians.  Though single gene PGx testing has long been used at Mayo Clinic in certain, focused departments for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons, the clinical evidence is expanding to implicate a greater number of genes and medications, laboratories are 
creating panel tests that cover more genes at a lesser cost than previous single gene tests.  The clinical value 
of these tests is now becoming more broadly understood. Prescribers who believe their patients have 
medication metabolism issues can currently tap into the PGx Testing Service by ordering PGx gene tests for 
diagnostic purposes and requesting a PGx e- consult or patient face to face consult with the PGx pharmacist for 
result s interpretation assistance. Additionally, a limited number of pilots offering clinical PGx testing primarily 
for predictive reasons are offered with the Center for Individualized Medicine.  The value of the service 
includes utilization of PGx testing as a tool for assisting health care providers improve the medication 
experience of their patients. Patients may also benefit from understand their own PGx variations and the 
relevance of their results and other family members. The service is also assisting providers in this new and 
growing field, by providing expertise and support to help prescribers tailor medications for their patients --
adjusting current mediations according to the patient’s genetic variations and/or providing valuable information 
for future prescribing events.

PRELIMINARY DATA  
Gastrointestinal traits (phenotypes) associated with obesity : Recently we published the characterized 
gastrointestinal functions, satiation and satiety , in 509 participants across th e normal weight to obesity 
spectrum . We found that obesity is associated with decreased satiation (higher caloric intake before feeling full, 
measure by volume to fullness [VTF] p=0.038),  large fasting gastric volume (GV, p=0.03), accelerated gastric 
emptying (GE) T 1/2 (solids: p<0.001; liquids: p=0.011),  and lower postprandial peak  plasma levels of PYY 
(p=0.003) . In addition, principal components (PC) analysis identified latent dimensions (LDs) accounting for 
~81% of OW -OB variation  and sub -classifies obesity (figure 2) in satiation (21%), gastric capacity (15%), 
behavioral (13%), gastric sensorimotor (11%) factors and others (40%) [3]. This obesity sub- classification may 
predict weight loss response to pharmacotherapy 
and bariatric endoscopy [3].   
Obesity phenotypes to pr edict weight loss 
response:  Thus far , we validated the applicability of 
obesity -related gastrointestinal quantitative traits in 
two randomized clinical trials [3, 10]. In a single -
center, randomized, parallel -group, doubl e-blind, 
placebo- controlled, 14- day study, we evaluated the 
effects of Phentermine- topiramate -ER (PhenTop)  
(7.5/46mg, orally, daily) on GE, GV, satiation, satiety, and fasting and postprandial gut hormones in 24 
obese adults using validated assays. PhenTop is 
approved for the treatment of obesity. However, its effects on gastric functions, satiation, satiety and 
relevant gut hormones are unknown. PhenTop was 
associated with reduced food intake at buffet meal 
(mean Δ 260kcal, p=0.032) and delayed GE solids 
(mean Δ GE4h 6%, p=0.03; and Δ GE T½ 19min, 
p=0.057). There were no significant differences in GV, satiation, GE of liquids and GI hormones. 
Patients on PhenTop had greater mean weight loss 
of 1.4kg than placebo (p=0.03). Weight loss on 
PhenTop was signific antly associated with kcal 
intake at a prior satiety test.  We concluded that PhenTop reduces food intake and delays GE of solids , suggesting 
central as well as peripheral mechanisms of action in inducing 
weight loss and that a prior satiety test predicts  weight loss 
with PhenTop (Figure  3) [3]. 
In another placebo- controlled trial, we studied the effect of  
exenatide, 5µg, SQ, twice daily for 30 days, on GE, satiety, 
satiation and weight loss in 20 obese participants with accelerated 
GE. Exenatide had a very significant effect on GE of solids 
(p<0.001) and reduced calorie intake at a buffet meal by an 
averag e 130kcal compared to placebo. The average weight loss 
was 1.3kg for exenatide and 0.5kg for the placebo group. We 
concluded from this relatively short duration study that exenatide 
reduces food intake and delays GE of solids ; and that a prior 
accelerated gastric emptying test predicts  weight loss with 
exenatide [10]. 
In a recent retrospective analysis, we have identified that the 
best responders to the intragastric balloon therapy are those 
individuals with an accelerated gastric emptying (p<0.001) and the 
greater delay in gastric emptying after intragastric balloon 
placement (p<0.001) [12].  
Quantitative traits - phenotypes are associated with higher

 BMI, distinguish obesity phenotypes, and may predict response to obesity pharmacotherapy and endoscopic 
devices [3]. However, the tests of quantitative GI traits are currently limited to a few research/academic 
centers. Thus, we have developed a novel and simple 
diagnostic- blood- test that predicts weight loss in obesity . 
The diagnostic test is based on an algorithm that combines 
candidate gene variants (SNPs), metabolites and metabolic 
peptides. We recently completed the analysis of 102 patients 
with obesity, matched for gender, age and BMI. These 
individuals were non- diabetic and were in not medications for 
weight loss. Based on the profile of each patient we were able to validate the main groups in obesity in 1) abnormal satiation, 
2) rapid return to hunger, 3) behavioral eating (identified by 
questionnaire) and 4) abnormal energy expenditure; plus a 
“mixed” group.  Once these variables were tested, we first 
created a combined logit regression model using stepwise 
variable selection to identify vari ables that are significantly 
associated with each of the phenotypic classes. The result 
included a combination 14 metabolites (amino -compounds, 
neurotransmitters and fatty acids), no candidate gene or 
metabolic peptide were included/make the cut (The 14 
metabolites are knowingly not disclosed per MCV/legal 
request - Mayo IP disclosure No. 2017 -040 and DR16- 520 – 
unpublished/confidential). Figure 2 shows the sub -
classification prediction accuracy of this combined model and 
an ROC analysis showed that this model has >0.90 AUC for 
all four classes. Next, we set out to derive binary classification 
models that can predict whether a patient belongs to one 
group over the others. As preliminary data, we derived Bayesian covariate predictors for abnormal satiation, 
behavioral eating, and abnormal energy expenditure (detailed models not shown here for lack of space). These 
models yielded an ROC AUC of 0.9414, 0.9668, and 0.8775. These data suggested that the serum metabolite 
levels hold all the information needed to pr edict obesity subclasses. We propose to develop a novel targeted 
panel -based blood assay using the metabolites in these models (both integrated model and independent 
binary models) and validate them against an independent cohort. We will also extend our st atistical analysis to 
develop a binary model for predicting whether a patient has rapid return to hunger phenotype.  
Quantitative traits are associated with higher BMI, distinguish obesity phenotypes, and may predict 
response to obesity  pharmacotherapy and endoscopic devices (Figure 1 ) [3]. However, these results were 
determined retrospectively and each of them was done independently. Thus, the identification of the obesity phenotype at baseline to guide obesity pharmacotherapy has not been tested yet and the outcom e is unknown 
in the clinical setting. Thus, there is a critical need to study the weight loss outcome using obesity 
phenotypes to guide therapy for obesity.  
 
Additionally, these tests of quantitative GI traits are currently limited to a few research/academic centers. 
Thus, we recently developed a Blood Test that may predict response to obesity therapy (Mayo IP disclosure 
No. 2017- 040 and DR16- 520 – unpublished/ confidential).  This blood assay has been validated against 
standard obesity phenotypes that predict weight response to obesity pharmacotherapy (Sensitivity/specificity 
>90%). The blood assay was developed after testing candidate gene variants (SNPs), metabolic peptides and 
metabolomics panel (amino- compounds, neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids, bile acids). The next logical 
step in the development of this test is to validate the assay in clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for obesity.  
 
Our overall  hypothesis  is that this obesity -phenotypes guided therapy will predict weight loss response to 
obesity therapy and will be able to identify the “responders” to each specific intervention compared to standard 
of care (hit -or-miss medication selection ). Thu s, we propose to validate the assay in two aims:

 HYPOTHESIS AND AIMS 
This unique quantitative data led to the overall hypothesis that weight loss with pharmacological agents may be 
individualized, based on the baseline abnormality in their obesity phenoty pe.  Thus, each baseline trait could 
be targeted by pharmacological actions of specific obesity medications.  
Hypothesis:  The identification of the obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy will enhance the weight loss 
response rate (i.e. percentage of pati ent with weight loss higher than 10 % at 12 weeks).  
Aim:  To compare the weight loss response rate to obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy  vs. control 
group.  
SIGNIFICANCE  
This proposal addresses a significant unmet public health need: the development of effective management 
approaches to treat obesity based in individual phenotypes. Currently, there are several safe and effective 
FDA-approved medications and devices for the  treatment of obesity. Unfortunately, the response to obesity 
treatment (medicines, devices or surgery) is highly variable. Obesity phenotypes can be used to predict weight 
loss response to pharmacotherapy and devices. Thus, it essential that we understand the predictors of 
response to each intervention for obesity to be able to select the right tool for the right patient with minimal or 
no side effects –  Individualized approach for obesity.  
RESEARCH PLAN  
Study Design:  
In a 12 week, pragmatic, 1:1 paralleled controlled trial of 200 participants with obesity; we will compare the 
weight loss response rate to obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy vs. standard of care in the Mayo 
Clinic Weight Management and Nutrition Clinic (See flow diagram below, Figure 1). Patients that are interest in 
Weight Management with medications will be randomized (at the clinical triage scheduling system) to be 
offered a diagnostic test to use an obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy (Intervention). A similar cohort 
who was not offered the test will be followed in parallel in a prospective manner (standard of care group). When patients are assigned to the physician in the Intervention clinic, they will be offered the diagnostic tests 
as part of their care, but at no cost for t he patient and the tests will be done under informed consent. The 
results of the tests will guide obesity pharmacotherapy (figure 1). All participants will be contacted clinically at 4 
and seen at 12 weeks (current standard in practice). All participants w ill receive , as standard of care, a 
standard intense lifestyle intervention, which consists of 2 -4 visits with registered dietitian and one visit with a 
behavioral psychologist. The phenotypic studies include (all performed in same day ): Fasting blood coll ection, 
resting energy expenditure, DEXA , gastric emptying with meal for breakfast, behavioral questionnaires, and 
nutrient drink test for lunch. Blood will be collected for assessment of metabolomic biomarkers, gastrointestinal 
hormones (GLP -1, PYY, CCK, bile acids), DNA (blood and buccal swab) and  pharmacogenomics . A stool kit 
will be given at the screen and will be returned at some point during the testing day or day after.  Stool sample 
will be analyzed for microbiome.   
Randomization and Allocation  
The randomization will be done at the level of the clinical appointment coordinators. Patients will call to request 
an appointment or will referred for Weight Management Consultation. As standard in a multiple- physician 
practice, patients will be “randomly ” assign to each physician calendar (unless patient or referral requests a  
specific physician). Patients will be assigned  to a physician offering standard of care or a physician offering 
obesity -phenotype- guided pharmacotherapy. Patients in the standard of  care group will not be aware of the 
other group (intervention);  those patients will be followed in a prospective by chart review in a paralleled control 
group.  The patients in the intervention group will be offered the testing to identify their phenotype;  they may 
select only standard of care and decline the testing. Patients who are randomly assign , are willing to start a 
medication for weight management , and are willing to be tested for phenotype will be enroll in the study. Once 
they agree to the testing, participants will be offered an informed consent . All subjects will be given a verbal 
explanation of the study, provided time to read and study the written consent form and its information, given 
opportunities to ask questions and a copy of the consent form.  Participants will be informed of their right to 
Andres Acosta MD, PhD  
Mayo Clinic  
 
 withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their clinical management now or in the future. 
Consent will be sought by one of the medical doctor investigators or the study coordinator, and consent will be 
documented by the participant’s signature on the consent form. Mayo’s Institutional Review Board will approve 
the process and protocol . The rest of the member of multidisciplinary team for weight management (i.e. clinical 
assistants, regist ered dietitians, psychologist, pharmacy will remain blinded). Physicians in the standard of care 
group will be blinded too. The allocation will be concealed at the level of randomization.  
Selection Participants  
 We plan to study a cohort of 2 00 patients with obesity  (BMI>30 kg/m2). Participants will be recruited 
from the Mayo Clinic Weight Management and Nutrition Clinic when they are offered a medication for weight 
loss as standard of care for obesity.  Our Weight Management and Nutrition Clinic  see more than 40 patients 
per week for obesity management  (>1200 patients per year) . One hundred participants (controls) will be 
follow ed prospectively (chart review) for  their weight loss after standard of care is provided. These participants 
will be blinded to the other arm of the study , and to their participation.  One hundred  participants (Intervention 
group) will be invited to participate in the phenotypic assessment of their obesity, will agree to guide their pharmacological intervention based on their phenotype results and agree to follow up their weight loss.  We will 
attempt to enroll approximately  25 patients in each group of the obesity -phenotypes (total=100).

 Stan dard of Care:  
All participants will received standard of care which consists of 1)  Intense lifestyle intervention, behavioral 
evaluation and treatment, and a medication as part of the regular clinic management for obesity.  
Intense Lifestyle Intervention and Behavioral Treatment  
All the participants will meet the multidisciplinary team which consists of an Obesity Expert physician a 
registered dietitian nutritionist, and behavioural psychologist as standard of care in our clinical practice. All 
participants will guided to 1) Nutrition: Reduce dietary intake below that required for energy balance by 
consuming 1200 -1500 calories per day for women and 1500 -1800 calories per day for men; 2) Physical 
Activity: reach the goal of 10,000 steps or more per day; 3) Exercise: reach the goal of 150 minutes or more of 
cardiovascular exercise/week; 4) Limit consumption of liquid calories  (i.e. sodas, juices, alcohol, etc.). 
Participants will meet with RDN at baseline at week ~2 for guidance and monitoring.  
Pharmacotherapy for obesity  
Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity can be considered if a patient has a body mass index (BMI) ≥  30  
kg/m2 or BMI >27 kg/m2 with a comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and obstructive 
sleep apnea[ 21]. Medical therapy should be initiated with dose escalation based on efficacy and tolerability to 
the recommended dose.  We do an assessment of efficacy and safety at 4 weeks. In both groups, medications 
will be assessed for drug interactions and potential side effects as standard of care.  
Control group:  Pharmacotherapy for obesity  
Standard of care pharmacotherapy for obesity recommends the following doses  and regimen for weight loss : 
• Phentermine: 15 -37.5 mg oral daily  
• Phentermine- Topiramate Extended Release (Qsymia®)  at dose of 7.5/46 mg oral daily 
• Lorcaserin (Belviq®)  at dose of 10 mg oral twice daily 
• Oral naltrexone extended- release/bupropion extended- release (NBSR; Contrave®)  at dose of 32/360 
mg oral daily (divided in 2 tables in morning and 2 tablets in evening)  
• Liraglutide (Saxenda®) at dose of 3 mg subcutaneous daily   
• Orlistat (Xenical®)  at 120 mg oral three times daily  
Intervention group: by obesity phenotype guided pharmacotherapy  
Participants in the intervention group will have 4 tests to assess 1) satiation, 2) Satiety/return to hunger , 3) 
behavioral , or 4) energy expenditure. As described on Figure 1 (above) , pharmacotherapy will b y guide based 
on the “abnormal” phenotype. In case of a mixed pattern or multiple abnormal phenotypes, the most prominent 
phenotype will be tackled.  
Algorithm diagnostic:  
1. satiation: Phentermine- Topiramate Extended Release (Qsymia®) at dose of 7.5/46 mg oral daily or  
Lorcaserin (Belviq®) at dose of 10 mg oral twice daily  
2. Satiety/return to hunger:  Liraglutide 3 mg SQ daily  
3. Behavioral/Psychological: Oral naltrexone extended- release/bupropion extended- release (NBSR; 
Contrave®) at dose of 32/360 mg oral dail y (divided in 2 tables in morning and 2 tablets in evening); or  
4. Energy expenditure: Phentermine 15 mg daily plus increase physical activity.  
 
Anthropometrics and phenotype studies  
Anthropometrics Measurements:  will be taken of hip- waist ratio, height, weight, b lood pressure, pulse at 
baseline and week 12.  
Phenotype studies:  
Participants will attend the Mayo Clinic Clinical Research and Trials Unit after an 8- hour fasting period, and the 
following validated quantitative traits (phenotypes) will be measured at baseline:  
a) The DEXA scan ( dual energy x -ray absorptiometry) will measure body composition.  
b) Resting energy expenditure: was assessed by indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood ( Parvo 
Medics, Sandy, UT).  
Andres Acosta MD, PhD  
Mayo Clinic  
 
 c) Gastric emptying (GE) of solids by sc intigraphy: The primary endpoint is gastric half -emptying time (GE 
t1/2) [3, 18, 32]. 
d) Appetite (hunger level) by visual analog score fast ing and after standard meal for GE and prior to the 
Satiation test [3]. 
e) Satiation will be measure by ad- libitum  buffet meal to measure total caloric intake and macronutrient 
distribution in the chosen food. Satiation will be reported in calories consumed at fullness (satiation)  [3]. 
f) Satiety by visual analog score postprandial after standard meal for GE and after to the Ad -libitum meal  
test for every 30 minutes for 2 hours  [3]. Satiety will be measured in length of time of fullness.  
g) Self-administered questionnaires  assessing affect, physical activity levels , attitudes, , body image, and 
eating behavior; details of each questionnaire are provided below . 
h) Samples collection, handling and storage: Samples were collected after an overnight fast  (of at least 8  
hours) in the morning within 7 and 9 am. Plasma was preserved following standard guidelines and 
protein degradation inhibitors, kalikrein and DPP -IV inhibitors were added to preserve the samples. 
Samples are stored at - 80ºC in the PI’s laboratory in the Guggenheim Bldg.  
a. Plasma gastrointestinal hormones ( Total and active Ghrelin, GLP -1, CCK, PYY and bile acids)  by 
radioimmunoassay, measured fasting, and 15, 45, and 90 minutes postprandial, with the primary 
endpoint being the peak postprandial level  (test should be done simultaneously to GE) .  
b. Targeted Metabolomics :  We will perform quantitative, targeted metabolomics of salient classes of 
compounds in plasma samples using mass spectrometry.  These assays are well -established, 
validated, and routinely performed in the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Core Laboratory.   Amino acids 
plus amino metabolites will be quantified in plasma by derivatizing wit h 6-aminoquinolyl -N-
hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate according to Waters MassTrak kit.  A 10- point calibration standard 
curve will be used for quantification of unknowns using a triple- stage quadrupole mass 
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Ultra) c oupled with an ultra performance liquid 
chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Acquity UPLC). Data acquisition will be performed using multiple -reaction monitoring (MRM). Concentrations of 42 analytes in each sample are calculated 
against their respective calibration curves with a measurement precision of < 5%.  Essential 
nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations,  such as myristic, palmitic, palmetoleic 
palmitoelaidic, stearic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic, will be measured agains t a 
six-point standard curve by LC/MS/MS, underivatized after extraction from plasma via negative 
electrospray ionization (ESI) and multiple reaction monitoring conditions. This technique was developed to replace the GC/MS method where NEFAs required methy lation before analysis. This 
technique reduces the uncertainty as to whether the methylation step increases FFA concentrations by inadvertently hydrolyzing other lipid classes.   Intra CV is < 3% for all analytes.  
c. Blood DNA . 
d. Bucal Swab DNA  for OneOme pharm acogenomics testing.  
i. Pharmacogenomics : Patients who have met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and have 
signed the informed consent will be asked to provide a one- time buccal scraping. This 
sample will be sent to OneOme™ Laboratory for use for the CLIA/ CAP approved 
RightMed™ test (PGx gene panel). The OneOme RightMed test is an end- to-end 
pharmacogenomics solution that includes pharmacogenomic testing services, data analysis, 
clinical interpretation, and interactive reporting.   The RightMed panel assesses 72 variants 
in 22 pharmacogenes, with seven cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) covering approximately 90 percent of human 
drug oxidation and nearly 50 percent of commonly used medications, and 15 genes r elated 
to drug action or metabolism (COMT, DPYD, DRD2, F2, F5, GRIK4, HTR2A, HTR2C, IL28B, NUDT15, OPRM1, SLCO1B1, TPMT, UGT1A1, and VKORC1). These genes were 
selected because their relationships with various medications are supported by substantial 
clinic al evidence (Appendix 1).  Results for the patient will be returned to Mayo Clinic and 
placed into the patient EHR to be utilized for clinical treatment decisions. Through chart review, including the patient’s current medication list as stated in the EHR, we will document 
previously  reported medication inefficacy and intolerance. This data will be entered into a 
database.  To assist in interpretation of the PGx test results, a PGx -trained pharmacist will 
review the test report, and document recommendations for the ordering provider v ia the e-
Consult mechanism. A patient letter based on their results may be recommended by the 
Andres Acosta MD, PhD  
Mayo Clinic  
 
 pharmacist on a case- by-case basis. During this process, we will document PGx variants, 
identify “actionable” variants potentially impacting current medications, all prescription(s) 
changes considered, and identify variants that might explain past medication issues.  If 
indicated due to PGx variants or current medication list, the patient may have a face- to-face 
or virtual visit with a pharmacist to discuss their P Gx results. If the patient participates in a 
face- to-face visit with a pharmacist as part of standard patient care, medication 
reconciliation would be performed and the data will be collected via interview.  As this is a 
clinical test, patients will be giv en information and education materials and references about 
PGx testing as appropriate, and will also have access to the lab results report and consult 
notes via the Mayo Clinic Patient Online Services portal. Patients may also request a copy 
of their results through May Clinic Medical Records.  A follow -up survey will be sent via U.S. 
mail to collect information regarding patients’ perceptions, satisfaction and outcomes of PGx testing, as well as behaviors that may result from having this PGx test. Informa tion collected 
includes, but is not limited to: prescription adjustments, satisfaction, perceived understanding, and sharing PGx results or information.  
i) Stool  will be collected and stored to study microbiome, short chain fatty acids and bile acids.  
 
Quest ionnaires to Assess GI Symptoms and Behavioral Disorders  
    Participants will complete a series of questionnaires (all included in the APPENDIX): Weight management 
Questionnaire (Mayo Clinic®), the and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Inventory [HAD [ 33]] to appraise 
the contribution of affective disorder.  
 
Behavioural Questionnaires  
a. AUDIT -C Alcoholism Screening Test  [34] - The AUDIT -C is a 3 -item alcohol screening questionnaire that 
reliably identifies participants who are hazardous alcohol drinkers or have active alcohol use disorders. This 
score will be used in screening by the study physician/nurse coordinator. The AUD IT-C is scored on a scale of 
0-12. Each AUDIT- C question has 5 answer choices. Points allotted are: a=0 points; b=1 point; c=2 points; d=3 
points; e=4 points. In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive, optimal for identifying hazardous 
drinking o r active alcohol use disorders. In women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive (same as 
above).   
b.   Eating Disorders Questionnaire - The Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns -Revised [35], is a valid 
measure of screening for eating disorders which has been used in several national multi -site field trials. 
Respondents are classified as binge eating disorder, purging bulimia nervosa, non -purging bulimia nervosa, or 
anorexia nervosa. We have used this instrument to screen for eating disorders in obese populat ions.  
c.   Body Image Satisfaction  -  The Multidimensional Body -Self Relations Questionnaire [36, 37]provides a 
standardized attitudinal assessment of body image, normed from a national body -image survey. Items are 
rated on a 5- point scale, ranging from 1=Definitely Disagree to 5=Definitely Agree. In this study, we will use 
one of the sub- scales, the Body Areas Satisfaction Scale, which measures feelings of satisfaction with discrete 
aspects  of physical appearance (e.g., face, weight, hair). Cronbach’s α  values range from .70 to .89 [37]. 
d.   Eating Behaviors   -  The Weight Efficacy Life- Style Questionnaire [WEL [38]] is a 20 -item eating self -
efficacy scale consisting of a total score and five situational factors: negative emotions, availability, social 
pressure , physical discomfort, and positive activities. Subjects are asked to rate their confidence about being 
able to successfully resist the urge to eat using a 10- point scale ranging from 0=not confident to 9=very 
confident.  
e.   Physical Activity Level  - The four-item Physical Activity Stages of Change Questionnaire [39]will be utilized 
to assess the physical activity level of participants. Mayo Clinic investigators, led by co -investigator Dr. Clark, 
have used these item s to explore the relationship between quality of life and physical activity in an NCI -funded 
study on long -term lung cancer survivors [39]. 
General Principles of Statistical Analyses  
Primary endpoint:  Percentage of responders (defined as number of participants who loss 10% or more of 
total body weight) compared to baseline in the obesity phenotype guided pharmacotherapy (intervention) group vs. standard of care. The secondary end points will be percent age of responders with at least 5% at 4 weeks , 
15% at 12 weeks, and 10% at 6 months and 12 months; percentage of responders at 5% , 10%  and 15% ; 
percentage of responders within each obesity -phenotype group at 4 and 12 weeks; side effects of medications 
and patient satisfaction.

Sample size assessment:  We propose a 1:1 design to compare effects of Intervention compared to Standard 
of Care in weight loss. The analysis will involve use of 2- way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with 
treatment; and the covariates to be considered include gender, BMI (at baseline).  The current standard of care 
suggests that approximate 35% of patients will lose more than 10% of body weight [1, 6, 13-15]. We estimate a 
detectable effect size difference (Δ) in percentage of responders for the intervention group compare to 
standard of care of more than 20% (55% intervention vs. 35% control). Using this proportion of responders  [2, 
5, 16-18], the sample size will be 100 participants in intervention group and 100 participants in standard of care 
group to demonstrate a treatment -related difference in weight loss (using α=0.05, 80% power, 2- sided t test , 
and 95% Confidence level ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anticipated results and significance:   
Our study individualizes obesity treatment to maximized pharmacotherapy outcome based on phenotyping obesity at baseline.  
 
Potential pitfalls, precautions taken, and alternative strategies:  
a. Feasibility  - Given high volume weight management clinic , we are confident we will recruit sufficient 
participants for these studies that involve only noninvasive tests  and standard of care treatment . 
b. Statistical power  has been addressed with appropriate sample sizes to demonstrate a difference in weight 
change on NBSR with and with phenotype vs. placebo.  
  Percentage difference (Δ) of participants with a 
weight loss 10 % or more [ % of responders 
compare to expected responders with standard 
of care  (approx. 35% in standard of care )] Intervention
